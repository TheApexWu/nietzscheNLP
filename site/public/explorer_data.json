In rare and isolated cases, \n^may really have happened that such a Will to Truth \u2014 a \nhn extravagant and adventurous pluck, a metaphysician's \nibition of the forlom hope \u2014 has participated therein: that \nich in the end always prefers a handful of \"certainty\" to \n[whole cartload of beautiful possibihties; there may even \npuritanical fanatics of conscience, who prefer to put their \n^t trust in a sure nothing, rather than in an uncertain someig. But that is Nihihsm, and the sign of a despairing. \n\n\n10 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nmortally wearied soul, notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a virtue may display. It seems, however, to be \notherwise with stronger and hveher thinkers who are still \neager for hfe. In that they side against appearance, and \nspeak supercihously of \"perspective,\" in that they rank the \ncredibihty of their own bodies about as low as the credibihty \nof the ocular evidence that \"the earth stands still,\" and thus, \napparently, allowing with complacency their securest possession to escape (for what does one at present beheve in \nmore firmly than in one's body?), \u2014 who knows if they are \nnot really trying to win back something which was formerly \nan even securer possession, something of the old domain of \nthe faith of former times, perhaps the \"immortal soul,\" perhaps \"the old God,\" in short, ideas by which they could hve \nbetter, that is to say, more vigourously and more joyously, \nthan by \"modem ideas\"? There is distrust of these modem \nideas in this mode of looking at things, a disbehef in all that \nhas been constructed yesterday and to-day; there is perhaps some shght admixture of satiety and scom, which can \nno longer endure the bric-a-brac of ideas of the most varied \norigin, such as so-called Positivism at present throws on the \nmarket; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fair \nmotleyness and patchiness of all these reahty-philosophasters, \nin whom there is nothing either new or true, except this \nmotlejTiess. Therein it seems to me that we should agree \nwith those sceptical anti-reahsts and knowledge-microscopists \nof the present day; their instinct, which repels them from \nmodem reahty, is unrefuted . . . what do their retrograde \nby-paths concem us! The main thing about them is nolA \nthat they wish to go \"back,\" but that they wish to get ca^cy \ntherefrom. A httle more strength, swing, courage, and \nartistic power, and they would be o\u00a7 \u2014 and not back! \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL ii \nI \nIX \nIt seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at \npresent to divert attention from the actual influence which \nKant exercised on German philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon himself. Kant \n\n\nwas first and foremost proud of his Table of Categories; \nwith it in his hand he said: \"This is the most difficult thing \nthat could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.\" \nLet us only understand this \"could be\"! He was proud of \nhaving discovered a new faculty in man, the faculty of \nsynthetic judgment a priori. Granting that he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid flourishing \nof German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, \nand on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible something \u2014 at all events \"new faculties\" \u2014 \nof which to be still prouder! \u2014 But let us reflect for a \nmoment \u2014 it is high time to do so. \"How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?\" Kant asks himself \u2014 and what is \nreally his answer? \"By means of a means (faculty)\" \u2014 ^but \nunfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly, and with such display of German profimdity and \nverbal flourishes, that one altogether loses sight of the \ncomical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer. People were beside themselves with dehght over this new fac^ ulty, and the jubilation reached its chmeix v/hen Kant further \ndiscovered a moral faculty in man \u2014 for at that time Germans \nwere still moral, not yet dabbhng in the \"Pohtics of hard \nfact.\" Then came the honeymoon of German philosophy. \nAll the young theologians of the Tiibingen institution went \nI mmediately into the groves \u2014 all seeking for \"faculties.\" \njri .tod what did they not find \u2014 in that innocent, rich, and still \nII \n12 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nyouthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, \nthe mahcious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet \ndistinguish between \"finding\" and \"inventing\"! Above all \na faculty for the \"transcendental\"; Schelhng christened it, \nintellectual intuition, and thereby gratified the most eamest \nlongings of the naturally pious-inchned Germans. One can \ndo no greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness, notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly in hoary and senile \nconceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with \nmoral indignation. Enough, however \u2014 the world grew older, \nand the dream vanished. A time came when people rubbed \ntheir foreheads, and they still rub them to-day. People had \nbeen dreaming, and first and foremost \u2014 old Kant. \"By \nmeans of a means (faculty)\" \u2014 he had said, or at least meant \nto say. But, is that \u2014 an answer? An explanation? Or \n\n\nis it not rather merely a repetition of the question? How \ndoes opium induce sleep? \"By means of a means (faculty),\" \nnamely the virtus dormitiva, rephes the doctor in Mohere, \nQuia est in eo virtus dormitiva, \nCujus est natura sensus assoupire. \nBut such rephes belong to the realm of comedy, and it is \nhigh time to replace the Kantian question, \"How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?\" by another question, \n\"Why is behef in such judgments necessary?\" \u2014 in effect, it \nhigh time that we should imderstand that such judgments, \nmust be beheved to be true, for the sake of the preservation of creatures hke ourselves; though they still might] \nnaturally be false judgments! Or, more plainly spokeUjj \nand roughly and readily \u2014 synthetic judgments a priori shoulc \nnot \"be possible\" at all; we have no right to them; in oui \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 13 \nmouths they are nothing but false judgments). Only, of \ncourse, the behef in their truth is necessary, as plausible \nbehef and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view \nof hfe. And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence \nwhich \"German philosophy\" \u2014 I hope you understand its \nright to inverted commas (gooseteet)? \u2014 has exercised \nthroughout the whole of Europe, there is no doubt that a \ncertain virtus dormitiva had a share in it; thanks to German \nphilosophy, it was a dehght to the noble idlers, the virtuous, \nthe mystics, the artists, the three- fourths Christians, and the \npohtical obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to \nthe still overwhelming sensuahsm which overflowed from \nthe last century into this, in short \u2014 \"sensus assoupire.\" . . . \ny2 \nAs regards materiahstic atomism, it is one of the best \nrefuted theories that have been advanced, and in Europe \nthere is now perhaps no one in the leamed world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it, except for \nconvenient everyday use (as an abbreviation of the means \nof expression) \u2014 thanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he \nand the Pole Copemicus have hitherto been the greatest and \nmost successful opponents of ocular evidence. For whilst \nCopemicus has persuaded us to beheve, contrary to all the \nsenses, that the earth does not stand fast, Boscovich has \ntaught us to abjure the behef in the last thing that \"stood \n\n\nfast\" of the earth \u2014 the behef in \"substance,\" in \"matter,\" \nin the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest \ntriumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on \nearth. One must, however, go still further, and also declare \nwar, relentless war to the knife, against the \"atomistic requirements\" which still lead a dangerous after-hfe in places \n14 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nwhere no one suspects them, hke the more celebrated \"metaphysical requirements\": one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism \nwhich Christianity has taught best and longest, the soulatomism. Let it be permitted to designate by this expression \nthe behef which regards the soul as something indestructible, \netemal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this behef \nought to be expelled from science! Between ourselves, it is \nnot at all necessary to get rid of \"the soul\" thereby, and thus \nrenounce one of the oldest and most venerated hj^otheses \u2014 \nas happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturahsts, who \ncan hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it. \nBut the way is open for new acceptations and refinements of \nthe soul-hypothesis; and such conceptions as \"mortal soul,\" \nand \"soul of subjective multiphcity,\" and \"soul as social \nstructure of the instincts and passions,\" want henceforth to \nhave legitimate rights in science. In that the new psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have \nhitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the \nidea of the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into \na new desert and a new distrust \u2014 it is possible that the older \npsychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of \nit; eventually, however, he finds that precisely thereby he \nis also condemned to invent \u2014 and, who knows? perhaps to \ndiscover the new."

        "RJ Hollingdale": "The causa sui is the best self-contradiction hitherto imagined, a kind of logical rape \nand unnaturalness: but mankind's extravagant pride has managed to get itself deeply \nand frightfully entangled with precisely this piece of nonsense. For the desire for \n\u2018freedom of will\u2019 in that metaphysical superlative sense which is unfortunately still \ndominant in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the whole and sole \nresponsibihty for one's actions and to absolve God, world, ancestors, chance, society \nfrom responsibihty for them, is nothing less than the desire to be precisely that \ncausa sui and, with more than Miinchhausen temerity, to pull oneself into existence \nout of the swamp of nothingness by one's own hair. Assuming it is possible in this \nway to get beyond the peasant simphcity of this celebrated concept \u2018free will\u2019 and \nbanish it from one's mind, I would then ask whoever does that to carry his \n\u2018enhghtenment\u2019 a step further and also banish from his mind the contrary of that \nunnatural concept \u2018free will\u2019: I mean \u2018unfree will\u2019, which amounts to an abuse of \ncause and effect. One ought not to make \u2018cause\u2019 and \u2018effect\u2019 into material things, as \nnatural scientists do (and those who, hke them, naturahze in their thinking \u2014 ), in \naccordance with the prevaihng mechanistic stupidity which has the cause press and \npush until it \u2018produces an effect\u2019; one ought to employ \u2018cause\u2019 and \u2018effect\u2019 only as \npure concepts, that is to say as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation, \nmutual understanding, not explanation. In the \u2018in itself\u2019 there is nothing of \u2018causal \nconnection\u2019, of \u2018necessity\u2019, of \u2018psychological unfreedom\u2019; there \u2018the effect\u2019 does not \n\u2018follow the cause\u2019, there no \u2018law\u2019 rules. It is we alone who have fabricated causes, \nsuccession, reciprocity, relativity, compulsion, number, law, freedom, motive, \npurpose; and when we falsely introduce this world of symbols into things and \nmingle it with them as though this symbol-world were an \u2018in itself\u2019, we once more \nbehave as we have always behaved, namely mythologically. \u2018Unfree will\u2019 is \n\n\nmythology: in real hfe it is only a question of strong and weak wills. \u2014 It is almost \nalways a symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker detects in every \n\u2018causal connection\u2019 and \u2018psychological necessity\u2019 something of compulsion, \nexigency, constraint, pressure, unfreedom: such feehngs are traitors, the person who \nhas them gives himself away. And, if I have observed correctly, \u2018unfreedom of will\u2019 \nis in general conceived as a problem from two completely antithetical standpoints \nbut always in a profoundly personal manner: one will at no price give up his \n\u2018responsibihty\u2019, his behef in himself, the personal right to his deserts (the vain ra\nbelong here \u2014 ), the other, on the contrary, will not be responsible for anything, to \nblame for anything, and out of an inner self-contempt wants to be able to shift off \nhis responsibihty for himself somewhere else.

Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself, That \nis the first principle of existentiahsm. . . . Before that projection of the \nself nothing exists . .. Man is responsible for what he is. Thus, the first \neffect of existentiahsm is that it puts every man in possession of himself as \nhe is, and places the entire responsibihty for his existence squarely upon his \nown shoulders\u201d (\u201cExistentiahsm Is a Humanism,\u201d included in Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre, ed.

Amongst \nlese, for instance, who are at present hving apart from \nigion in Germany, I find \"free-thinkers\" of diversified \n64 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nspecks and origin, but above all a majority of those in \nwhom laboriousness from generation to generation has dissolved the rehgious instincts; so that they no longer know \nwhat purpose rehgions serve, and only note their existence \nin the world with a kind of dull astonishment. They feel \nthemselves already fully occupied, these good people, be it \nby their business or by their pleasures, not to mention the \n'Tatherland,\" and the newspapers, and their \"family duties\"; it seems that they have no time whatever left for \nrehgion; and above all, it is not obvious to them whether it \nis a question of a new business or a new pleasure \u2014 for it is \nimpossible, they say to themselves, that people should go to \nchurch merely to spwil their tempers.

Among those indifferent persons may be reckoned \nnowadays the majority of German Protestants of the middle \nclasses, especially in the great laborious centres of trade and \ncommerce; also the majority of laborious scholars, and the \nentire University personnel (with the exception of the theologians, whose existence and possibihty there always givesj \npsychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve), \nthe part of pious, or merely church-going people, there is \nseldom any idea of how much goodwill, one might say arbitrary will, is now necessary for a German scholar to take thej \nproblem of rehgion seriously; his whole profession (and as ij \n\n\nhave said, his whole workmanhke laboriousness, to which he \nis compelled by his modem conscience) inchnes him to \nlofty and almost charitable serenity as regards rehgion, wit \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 65 \nwhich is occasionally mingled a shght disdain for the \"uncleanhness\" of spirit which he takes for granted wherever \nany one still professes to belong to the Church. It is only \nwith the help of history {not through his own personal experience, therefore) that the scholar succeeds in bringing \nhimself to a respectful seriousness, and to a certain timid deference in presence of rehgions; but even when his sentiments \nhave reached the stage of gratitude towards them, he has not \npersonally advanced one step nearer to that which still maintains itself as Church or as piety; perhaps even the contrary. \nThe practical indifference to rehgious matters in the midst \nof which he has been bom and brought up, usually subhmates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanhness, \nwhich shuns contact with rehgious men and things; and it \nmay be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which \nprompts him to avoid the dehcate trouble which tolerance \nitself brings with it. \u2014 Every age has its own divine type of \nnaivete, for the discovery of which other ages may envy it: \nand how much naivete \u2014 adorable, childhke, and boundlessly \nfoohsh naivete is involved in this behef of the scholar in his \nsuperiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance, in the unsuspecting, simple certainty with which his instinct treats the \nrehgious man as a lower and less valuable type, beyond, \nbefore, and above which he himself has developed \u2014 he, the \nhttle arrogant dwarf and mob-mem, the sedulously alert, \nhead-and-hand drudge of \"ideas,\" of \"modem ideas\"!"

Bald sprang\ndie Furcht vor verkappter Mystik und Grenzberichtigung des Erkennens\nhervor; bald die Missachtung einzelner Philosophen, welche sich\nunwillk\u00fcrhch zur Missachtung der Philosophie verallgemeinert hatte.\nAm h\u00e4ufigsten endhch fand ich bei jungen Gelehrten hinter der\nhochm\u00fcthigen Geringsch\u00e4tzung der Philosophie die schhmme Nachwirkung\neines Philosophen selbst, dem man zwar im Ganzen den Gehorsam\n\ngek\u00fcndigt hatte, ohne doch aus dem Banne seiner wegwerfenden\nWerthsch\u00e4tzungen anderer Philosophen herausgetreten zu sein: - mit\ndem Ergebniss einer Gesammt-Verstimmung gegen alle Philosophie.\n(Dergestalt scheint mir zum Beispiel die Nachwirkung Schopenhauer's\nauf das neueste Deutschland zu sein: - er hat es mit seiner\nunintelhgenten Wuth auf Hegel dahin gebracht, die ganze letzte\nGeneration von Deutschen aus dem Zusammenhang mit der deutschen Cultur\nherauszubrechen, welche Cultur, Alles wohl erwogen, eine H\u00f6he und\ndivinatorische Feinheit des historischen Sinns gewesen ist: aber\nSchopenhauer selbst war gerade an dieser Stelle bis zur Geniaht\u00e4t\narm, unempf\u00e4nghch, undeutsch.) \u00dcberhaupt in's Grosse gerechnet, mag\nes vor Allem das Menschhche, Allzumenschhche, kurz die Armsehgkeit\nder neueren Philosophen selbst gewesen sein, was am gr\u00fcndhchsten der\nEhrfurcht vor der Philosophie Abbruch gethan und dem p\u00f6belm\u00e4nnischen\nInstinkte die Thore aufgemacht hat.

        "RJ Hollingdale": "At the risk that morahzing will here too prove to be what it has always been \u2014 \nnamely an undismayed montrer ses plaies, as Balzac says \u2014 I should hke to venture \nto combat a harmful and improper displacement of the order of rank between \nscience and philosophy which is today, quite unnoticed and as if with a perfect good \nconscience, threatening to become estabhshed. In my view it is only from one's \nexperience \u2014 experience always means bad experience, does it not? \u2014 that one can \nacquire the right to speak on such a higher question of rank: otherwise one will talk \nhke a bhnd man about colours or hke women and artists against science (\u2018oh this \nwicked science\u2019, their modesty and instinct sighs, \u2018it always exposes the facts!\u2019\u2014-). \nThe Declaration of Independence of the man of science, his emancipation from \nphilosophy, is one of the more subtle after-effects of the democratic form and \nformlessness of hfe: the self-glorification and presumption of the scholar now \n\n\nstands everywhere in full bloom and in its finest springtime \u2014 which does not mean \nto say that in this case self-praise smells sweetly. \u201cAway with all masters!\u2019 \u2014 that is\nwhat the plebeian instinct desires here too; and now that science has most \nsuccessfully resisted theology, whose \u2018hand-maid\u2019 it was for too long, it is now, with \ngreat high spirits and a plentiful lack of understanding, taking it upon itself to lay \ndown laws for philosophy and for once to play the \u2018master\u2019 \u2014 what am I saying? to \nplay the philosopher itself. My memory \u2014 the memory of a man of science, if I may \nsay so! \u2014 is full of arrogant naiveties I have heard about philosophy and \nphilosophers from young scientists and old physicians (not to speak of the most \ncultured and conceited of all scholars, the philologists and schoolmen, who are both \nby profession \u2014). Now it was the speciahst and jobbing workman who instinctively \nopposed synthetic undertakings and capacities in general; now the industrious \nlabourer who had got a scent of the otium and noble luxury in the philosopher's \nphysical economy and felt wronged and diminished by it. Now it was that colour \nbhndness of the utihty man who sees in philosophy nothing but a series of refuted \nsystems and a wasteful expenditure which \u2018benefits\u2019 nobody. Now a fear of disguised \nmysticism and a rectification of the frontiers of knowledge leaped out; now a \ndisrespect for an individual philosopher which had involuntarily generahzed itself \ninto a disrespect for philosophy. Finally, what I found most frequently among young \nscholars was that behind the arrogant disdain for philosophy there lay the evil aftereffect of a philosopher himself, from whom they had, to be sure, withdrawn their \nallegiance, without, however, having got free from the spell of his disparaging \nevaluation of other philosophers \u2014 the result being a feehng of ill humour towards \nphilosophy in general. (This is the sort of after-effect which, it seems to me, \nSchopenhauer, for example, has had on Germany in recent years \u2014 with his \nunintelhgent rage against Hegel he succeeded in disconnecting the entire last \ngeneration of Germans from German culture, which culture was, all things \nconsidered, a high point and divinatory refinement of the historical sense: but \nSchopenhauer himself was in precisely this respect poor, unreceptive and unGerman to the point of genius.) In general and broadly speaking, it may have been \nabove all the human, all too human element, in short the poverty of the most recent \nphilosophy itself, which has been most thoroughly prejudicial to respect for \nphilosophy and has opened the gates to the instinct of the plebeian. For one must \nadmit how completely the whole species of a Herachtus, a Plato, an Empedocles, \nand whatever else these royal and splendid hermits of the spirit were called, is \nlacking in our modem world; and to what degree, in face of such representatives of \nphilosophy as are, thanks to fashion, at present as completely on top as they are \ncompletely abysmal (in Germany, for example, the two hons of Berhn, the anarchist \nEugen D\u00fchring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann) \u2014 a worthy man of \nscience is justified in feehng he is of a better species and descent. It is, in partic\nthe sight of those hotchpotch-philosophers who call themselves \u2018philosophers of \nreahty\u2019 or \u2018positivists\u2019 which is capable of implanting a perilous mistrust in the sou\nof an ambitious young scholar: these gentlemen are at best scholars and speciahsts \nthemselves, that fact is palpable! \u2014 they are one and all defeated men brought back \nunder the sway of science, who at some time or other demanded more of \nthemselves without having the right to this \u2018more\u2019 and the responsibihty that goes \nwith it \u2014 and who now honourably, wrathfully, revengefully represent by word and \ndeed the unbehef in the lordly task and lordhness of philosophy. Finally: how could \n\n\nthings be otherwise! Science is flourishing today and its good conscience shines in \nits face, while that to which the whole of modem philosophy has gradually sunk, \nthis remnant of philosophy, arouses distrust and displeasure when it does not arouse \nmockery and pity. Philosophy reduced to \u2018theory of knowledge\u2019, actually no more \nthan a timid epochism and abstinence doctrine: a philosophy that does not even get \nover the threshold and painfully denies itself the right of entry \u2014 that is philosophy \nat its last gasp, an end, an agony, something that arouses pity.

        "Marion Faber": "RUNNING the risk that morahzing, even my own, will prove to be \nwhat it always has been (an unabashed montrer ses plaies,* according \nto Balzac), I would hke to try to argue against an unseemly and \nharmful hierarchical shift between science* and philosophy that is \nnow threatening to develop quite unnoticed and, it seems, in good \nconscience. In my opinion, a person\u2019s right to speak about so \nelevated a question as hierarchy grows out of his experience (and \nexperience, I think, always means bad experience?), so that he is \nnot speaking about colour as the bhnd might do, or against science \nas women and artists might (\u2018Oh, this nasty old science!\u2019 sighs their \ninstinct and their shame, \u2018it\u2019s always finding out about everything\u201d). \nThe scientist\u2019s Declaration of Independence, his emancipation from \nphilosophy, is one of the more subtle influences of the democratic \ndisposition (and indisposition): the scholar\u2019s overweening selfglorification is in full bloom everywhere these days, in its finest \nspringtime\u2014which is not yet to suggest that in this case self-praise \nsmells sweet.* \u2018Down with all masters!\u2019\u2014that\u2019s what the rabble \ninstinct is urging here too; and science, after its great success in \nwarding off theology, whose \u2018handmaid\u2019 it was for too long, is now \narrogantly and ignorantly intent on making laws for philosophy and \ntaking its own tum at playing the \u2018master \u2014what am I saying? the \nphilosopher. My memory (a scientific man\u2019s memory, if you permit \nme to say so!) is bursting with naive remarks about philosophy and \nphilosophers that I have heard made by arrogant young natural \nscientists and old doctors (not to mention the most cultured and \nconceited* of scholars, the philologists and pedagogues, who are \nboth by profession). Now it was an idler or speciahst who instinctively resisted any kind of synthethic abihty or project; now a \ndihgent worker who had caught a whiff of otium* and elegant \nvoluptuousness in the philosopher\u2019s inner economy and felt \n94 Beyond Good and Evil \ncompromised and diminished by it. Now it was the colour-bhndness \nof a utihtarian who sces nothing in philosophy but a series of refuted \nsystems and a wasteful display that isn\u2019t \u2018good for\u2019 anything. Now \nit was the fear of veiled mysticism and of newly defined hmits to \nknowledge that leapt to the fore; and now a disdain for particular \nphilosophers, unwittingly generahzed into disdain for philosophy \nin general. But most frequently I found that underlying the young \nscholars\u2019 arrogant condescension towards philosophy was the bad \ninfluence of a philosopher himself, one whom they gencrally no \nlonger followed, it is true, but whose spell-binding dismissive \nassessments of other philosophers they had not shaken off\u2014the \nresult then being complete annoyance with all philosophy. (It seems \nto me that Schopenhauer, for example, has had this kind of effect \n\n\non Germany most recently\u2014with his unintelhgent wrath towards \nHegel he has succeeded in wrenching a whole generation of young \nGermans out of their relation to German culture, a culture which, \nweighing everything carefully, represented a supreme divinatory \nrefinement of the /istorica/ sense: but in just this area Schopenhauer \nhimself was almost brilhantly wanting, unreceptive, un-German.) \nIn general and on the whole, it may well have been the human, alltoo-human quahty of recent philosophy, its poverty in short, that \nhas most thoroughly hampered any possible respect for philosophy \nand opened the gates for the rabble instinct. Let us admit to \nourselves how greatly our modem world lacks the whole strain of \nmen hke Herachtus, Plato, Empedocles, and all the other splendid, \nroyal hermits of the spirit; and given such representatives of philosophy as the ones whom today\u2019s fashion has set at the top of \nthe heap\u2014and beneath respect\u2014(hke the two hons of Berhn, the \nanarchist Eugen D\u00fchring* and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann* in Germany), how entitled an honest man of science is to \nfeel that he is of a better strain and parentage. The sight of those \nhodgepodge philosophers who call themselves \u2018reahty philosophers\u2019 \nor \u2018positivists\u2019 is especially capable of inspiring an ambitious young \nscholar\u2019s heart with dangerous distrust: at best, these people are \nscholars and speciahsts themselves, it is clear as day! Indeed, they \nare all of them people who have been overcome and retrieved by \nthe dominion of science; at one time or another they wanted \nmore of themselves, but they had no right to this \u2018more\u2019 and its \nresponsibihty, and now they represent in word and deed, honourWe Scholars 95 \nably, fiercely, vengefully, a disbehef in the masters\u2019 task and the \nmasterfulness of philosophy. And in the end\u2014how could it be \notherwise! Science is abloom these days, its good conscience shining \nfrom its face, while recent philosophy has gradually sunk to its \ndregs, awakening distrust and despondence if not scom and pity. \nPhilosophy reduced to a \u2018theory of cognition\u2019, really no more than \na shy epochism and doctrine of renunciation; a philosophy that \ndoesn\u2019t even get beyond the threshold, scrupulously refusing itself \nthe right to enter: this is philosophy at its last gasp, an end, an \nagony, something to evoke pity. How could a philosophy hke that\u2014 \nbe the master!",
        "Judith Norman": "At the risk that morahzing will prove once again to be what it always was \n(namely, an undismayed montrer ses plaies,\" in the words of Balzac), I will \ndare to speak out against an inappropriate and harmful shift in the rank \norder between science and philosophy; this shift has gone completely unnoticed and now threatens to settle in with what looks hke the clearest of \nconsciences. I mean: people need to speak from experience (and experience \nalways seems to mean bad experience, doesn't it?) when it comes to such \nlofty questions of rank, or else they are hke bhnd people talking about \ncolors or hke women and artists speaking out against science (Oh, this \nawful science,\u201d their instincts and shame will sigh, \u201cit always gets to the \nbottom of things!\u201d \u2014). The scientific man's declaration of independence, \nhis emancipation from philosophy, is one of the more subtle effects of the \ndemocratic way of hfe (and death): this self-glorification and presumptuousness of the scholar is in the full bloom of spring, flowering everywhere \nyou look, \u2014 which isn't to say that this self-importance has a pleasant smell. \n\u201cAway with all masters!\" \u2014 that\u2019s what the rabble instinct wants, even here. \nAnd now that science has been so utterly successful in fending off theology, after having been its \u201chandmaiden\u201d for far too long, it is so high in \n\n\nspirits and low on sense that it wants to lay down laws for philosophy and, \nfor once, play at being \u201cmaster\u201d \u2014 what am I saying! play at being philosopher. My memory (the memory ofa scientific man, if you will!) is teeming \nwith the arrogantly naive comments about philosophy and philosophers \nthat I have heard from young natural scientists and old physicians (not to \n1 \u201cShowing one's wounds.\"",
        "Helen Zimmern": "At the risk that morahsing may also reveal itself here as \nthat which it has always been \u2014 namely, resolutely montter \nses plaies, according to Balzac \u2014 I would venture to protest \nagainst an improper and injurious alteration of rank, which \nquite unnoticed, and as if with the best conscience, threatens \nnowadays to estabhsh itself in the relations of science and \nphilosophy. I mean to say that one must have the right \nout of one's own experience \u2014 experience, as it seems to me^ \nalways imphes unfortunate experience? \u2014 to treat of such \nan important question of rank, so as not to speak of colour \nhke the bhnd, or against science hke women and artists \n(\"Ah! this dreadful science!\" sigh their instinct and their \nshame, \"it always finds things out!\") The declaration of \nindependence of the scientific man, his emancipation from \nphilosophy, is one of the subtler after-effects of democratic \norganisation and disorganisation: the self-glorification and \nself-conceitedness of the leamed man is now everywhere in \nfull bloom, and in its best springtime \u2014 which does not mean \nto imply that in this case self-praise smells sweetly. Here \nalso the instinct of the populace cries, \"Freedom from all \nmasters!\" and after science has, with the happiest results,"
