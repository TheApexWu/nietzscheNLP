    "Gutenberg": "O sancta simplicitas! In welcher seltsamen Vereinfachung und Fälschung\nlebt der Mensch! Man kann sich nicht zu Ende wundem, wenn man sich\nerst einmal die Augen für dies Wunder eingesetzt hat! Wie haben wir\nAlles um uns hell und frei und leicht und einfach gemacht! wie wussten\nwir unsem Sinnen einen Freipass für alles Oberflächhche, unserm\nDenken eine götthche Begierde nach muthwilhgen Sprüngen und\nFehlschlüssen zu geben! - wie haben wir es von Anfang an verstanden,\nuns unsre Unwissenheit zu erhalten, um eine kaum begreifhche\nFreiheit, Unbedenkhchkeit, Unvorsichtigkeit, Herzhaftigkeit,\nHeiterkeit des Lebens, um das Leben zu geniessen! Und erst auf diesem\nnunmehr festen und granitnen Grunde von Unwissenheit durfte sich\nbisher die Wissenschaft erheben, der Wille zum Wissen auf dem Grunde\neines viel gewaltigeren Willens, des Willens zum Nicht-wissen, zum\nUngewissen, zum Unwahren! Nicht als sein Gegensatz, sondem - als\nseine Verfeinerung! Mag nämhch auch die Sprache, hier wie anderwärts,\nnicht über ihre Plumpheit hinauskönnen und fortfahren, von Gegensätzen\nzu reden, wo es nur Grade und mancherlei Feinheit der Stufen giebt;\nmag ebenfalls die eingefleischte Tartüfferie der Moral, welche jetzt\nzu unserm unüberwindhchen \"Fleisch und Blut\" gehört, uns Wissenden\nselbst die Worte im Munde umdrehen: hier und da begreifen wir es und\nlachen darüber, wie gerade noch die beste Wissenschaft uns am besten\nin dieser vereinfachten, durch und durch künsthchen, zurecht\ngedichteten, zurecht gefälschten Welt festhalten will, wie sie\nunfreiwilhg-wilhg den Irrthum hebt, weil sie, die Lebendige, - das\nLeben hebt!",

    "Hollingdale": "O sancta simplicitas! What strange simphfication and falsification mankind lives in! \nOne can never cease to marvel once one has acquired eyes for this marvel! How we \nhave made everything around us bright and free and easy and simple! How we have \nknown how to bestow on our senses a passport to everything superficial, on our \nthoughts a divine desire for wanton gambolhng and false conclusions! — how we \nhave from the very beginning understood how to retain our ignorance so as to enjoy \nan almost inconceivable freedom, frivohty, impetuosity, bravery, cheerfulness of \nlife, so as to enjoy life! And only on this now firm and granite basis of ignorance \nhas knowledge hitherto been able to rise up, the will to knowledge on the basis of a \n\n\nfar more powerful will, the will to non-knowledge, to the uncertain, to the untrue! \nNot as its antithesis but — as its refinement! For even if, here as elsewhere, language\ncannot get over its coarseness and continues to speak of antitheses where there are \nonly degrees and many subtleties of gradation; even if hkewise the incamate \ntartuffery of morals which is now part of our invincible ‘flesh and blood’ twists the \nwords in the mouths even of us men of knowledge: here and there we grasp that fact \nand laugh at how it is precisely the best knowledge that wants most to hold us in this \nsimphfied, altogether artificial, fabricated, falsified world, how it is willy-nilly i\nwith error because, as a hving being, it is — in love with life!",

    "Faber": "O sancta simplicitas\\* How strangely simphfied and false are people’s \nlives! Once we have focused our eyes on this wonder, there is no \nend to the wonderment! See how we have made everything around \nus bright and free and light and simple! Weren’t we clever to give \nour senses free access to everything superficial, to give our minds \na divine craving for headlong leaps and fallacies! How we have \nmanaged from the beginning to chng to our ignorance, in order \nto enjoy a life of almost inconceivable freedom, thoughtlessness, \ncarelessness, heartiness, cheerfulness—to enjoy life! And only upon \nthis foundation of ignorance, now as firm as granite, could our \nscience be established, and our will to knowledge only upon the \nfoundation of a much more powerful will, the will to no knowledge, \nto uncertainty,* to untruth—not as the opposite of the former will, \nbut rather—as its refinement! For even if /anguage, in this case as \nin others, cannot get past its own unwieldiness and continues to \nspeak of oppositions where there are really only degrees and many \nfine differences of grade; even if we the knowing also find the \nwords in our mouths twisted by the ingrained moral hypocrisy that \nis now part of our insuperable ‘flesh and blood’, now and then we \nunderstand what has happened, and laugh at how even the very \nbest science would keep us trapped in this simphfied, thoroughly \nartificial, neatly concocted, neatly falsified world, how the best \nscience loves error whether it will or not, because science, being \nalive—loves life!",
