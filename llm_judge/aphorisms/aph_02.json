    "Gutenberg": "\"Wie könnte Etwas aus seinem Gegensatz entstehn? Zum Beispiel die\nWahrheit aus dem Irrthume? Oder der Wille zur Wahrheit aus dem Willen\nzur Täuschung? Oder die selbstlose Handlung aus dem Eigennutze? Oder\ndas reine sonnenhafte Schauen des Weisen aus der Begehrhchkeit?\nSolcherlei Entstehung ist unmöghch; wer davon träumt, ein Narr, ja\nSchhmmeres; die Dinge höchsten Werthes müssen einen anderen, eigenen\nUrsprung haben, - aus dieser vergänghchen verführerischen täuschenden\ngeringen Welt, aus diesem Wirrsal von Wahn und Begierde sind sie\nunableitbar! Vielmehr im Schoosse des Sein's, im Unvergänghchen,\nim verborgenen Gotte, im `Ding an sich` - da muss ihr Grund hegen,\nund sonst nirgendswo!\" - Diese Art zu urtheilen macht das typische\nVorurtheil aus, an dem sich die Metaphysiker aller Zeiten wieder\nerkennen lassen; diese Art von Werthschätzungen steht im Hintergrunde\naller ihrer logischen Prozeduren; aus diesem ihrem \"Glauben\" heraus\nbemühn sie sich um ihr \"Wissen\", um Etwas, das feierhch am Ende als\n\"die Wahrheit\" getauft wird. Der Grundglaube der Metaphysiker ist der\nGlaube an die Gegensätze der Werthe. Es ist auch den Vorsichtigsten\nunter ihnen nicht eingefallen, hier an der Schwelle bereits zu\nzweifeln, wo es doch am nöthigsten war: selbst wenn sie sich gelobt\nhatten \"de omnibus dubitandum\". Man darf nämhch zweifeln, erstens, ob\nes Gegensätze überhaupt giebt, und zweitens, ob jene volksthümhchen\nWerthschätzungen und Werth-Gegensätze, auf welche die Metaphysiker ihr\nSiegel gedrückt haben, nicht vielleicht nur Vordergrunds-Schätzungen\nsind, nur vorläufige Perspektiven, vielleicht noch dazu aus einem\n\nWinkel heraus, vielleicht von Unten hinauf, Frosch-Perspektiven\ngleichsam, um einen Ausdruck zu borgen, der den Malem geläufig ist?\nBei allem Werthe, der dem Wahren, dem Wahrhaftigen, dem Selbstlosen\nzukommen mag: es wäre möghch, dass dem Scheine, dem Willen zur\nTäuschung, dem Eigennutz und der Begierde ein für alles Leben höherer\nund grundsätzhcherer Werth zugeschrieben werden müsste. Es wäre sogar\nnoch möghch, dass was den Werth jener guten und verehrten Dinge\nausmacht, gerade darin bestünde, mit jenen schhmmen, scheinbar\nentgegengesetzten Dingen auf verfänghche Weise verwandt, verknüpft,\nverhäkelt, vielleicht gar wesensgleich zu sein. Vielleicht! - Aber wer\nist Willens, sich um solche gefährhche Vielleichts zu kümmem! Man\nmuss dazu schon die Ankunft einer neuen Gattung von Philosophen\nabwarten, solcher, die irgend welchen anderen umgekehrten Geschmack\nund Hang haben als die bisherigen, - Philosophen des gefährhchen\nVielleicht in jedem Verstande. - Und allen Emstes gesprochen: ich\nsehe solche neue Philosophen heraufkommen.",

Such origins are impossible; \nwhoever dreams of them is a fool, indeed worse; the things of the \nhighest value must have another, pecuhar origin—they cannot be \nderived from this transitory, seductive, deceptive, paltry world, from \nthis turmoil of delusion and lust, Rather from the lap of Being, the \nintransitory, the hidden god, the ‘thing-in-itself—there must be \ntheir basis, and nowhere else.” \nThis way of judging constitutes the typical prejudgment and \nprejudice which give away the metaphysicians of all ages; this kind \nof valuation looms in the background of all their logical procedures; it is on account of this “faith” that they trouble themselves \nabout “knowledge,” about something that is finally baptized solemnly as “the truth.” The fundamental faith of the metaphysicians \nis the faith in opposite values.?

For all the value \nthat the true, the truthful, the selfless may deserve, it would still be \npossible that a higher and more fundamental value for life might \nhave to be ascribed to deception, selfishness, and lust. It might even \nbe possible that what constitutes the value of these good and revered things is precisely that they are insidiously related, tied to, \nand involved with these wicked, seemingly opposite things—maybe \neven one with them in essence.

    "Hollingdale": "‘How could something originate in its antithesis? Truth in error, for example? Or \nwill to truth in will to deception? Or the unselfish act in self-interest?

Such origination is impossible; he who \ndreams of it is a fool, indeed worse than a fool; the things of the highest value must \nhave another origin of their own — they cannot be derivable from this transitory, \nseductive, deceptive, mean httle world, from this confusion of desire and illusion!

The \nfundamental faith of the metaphysicians is the faith in antithetical values. It has not\noccurred to even the most cautious of them to pause and doubt here on the \nthreshold, where however it was most needful they should: even if they had vowed \nto themselves ‘de omnibus dubitandum .

It might even be possible that \nwhat constitutes the value of those good and honoured things resides precisely in \ntheir being artfully related, knotted and crocheted to these wicked, apparently \nantithetical things, perhaps even in their being essentially identical with them. \nPerhaps! — But who is wilhng to concem himself with such dangerous perhapses! \nFor that we have to await the arrival of a new species of philosopher, one which \npossesses tastes and inchnations opposite to and different from those of its \npredecessors — philosophers of the dangerous ‘perhaps’ in every sense. — And to \nspeak in all seriousness: I see such new philosophers arising.",
    "Norman": "“How could anything originate out of its opposite? Truth from error, for \ninstance? Or the will to truth from the will to deception? Or selfless action from self-interest?

    "Faber": "‘How could something arise from its opposite? Truth from error, \nfor example? Or the will to truth from the will to deception? Or \naltruism from egoism?
