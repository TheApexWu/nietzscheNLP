    "Gutenberg": "Nach einem so fröhhchen Eingang möchte ein emstes Wort nicht\nüberhört werden: es wendet sich an die Emstesten. Seht euch vor,\nihr Philosophen und Freunde der Erkenntniss, und hütet euch vor dem\nMartyrium! Vor dem Leiden \"um der Wahrheit willen\"! Selbst vor der\neigenen Vertheidigung! Es verdirbt eurem Gewissen alle Unschuld und\nfeine Neutrahtät, es macht euch halsstarrig gegen Einwände und rothe\nTücher, es verdummt, verthiert und verstiert, wenn ihr im Kampfe mit\nGefahr, Verlästerung, Verdächtigung, Ausstossung und noch gröberen\nFolgen der Feindschaft, zuletzt euch gar als Vertheidiger der Wahrheit\nauf Erden ausspielen müsst: - als ob \"die Wahrheit\" eine so harmlose\nund täppische Person wäre, dass sie Vertheidiger nöthig hätte! und\ngerade euch, ihr Ritter von der traurigsten Gestalt, meine Herren\nEckensteher und Spinneweber des Geistes! Zuletzt wisst ihr gut genug,\ndass nichts daran hegen darf, ob gerade ihr Recht behaltet, ebenfalls\ndass bisher noch kein Philosoph Recht behalten hat, und dass eine\npreiswürdigere Wahrhaftigkeit in jedem kleinen Fragezeichen hegen\ndürfte, welches ihr hinter eure Leibworte und Liebhngslehren (und\ngelegenthch hinter euch selbst) setzt, als in allen feierhchen\nGebärden und Trümpfen vor Anklägem und Gerichtshöfen! Geht heber bei\nSeite! Fheht in's Verborgene! Und habt eure Maske und Feinheit, dass\n\nman euch verwechsele! Oder ein Wenig fürchte! Und vergesst mir den\nGarten nicht, den Garten mit goldenem Gitterwerk! Und habt Menschen um\neuch, die wie ein Garten sind, - oder wie Musik über Wassem, zur Zeit\ndes Abends, wo der Tag schon zur Erinnerung wird: - wählt die gute\nEinsamkeit, die freie muthwilhge leichte Einsamkeit, welche euch auch\nein Recht giebt, selbst in irgend einem Sinne noch gut zu bleiben! Wie\ngiftig, wie hstig, wie schlecht macht jeder lange Krieg, der sich\nnicht mit offener Gewalt führen lässt! Wie persönhch macht eine\nlange Furcht, ein langes Augenmerk auf Feinde, auf möghche Feinde!\nDiese Ausgestossenen der Gesellschaft, diese Lang-Verfolgten,\nSchhmm-Gehetzten, - auch die Zwangs-Einsiedler, die Spinoza's\noder Giordano Bruno's - werden zuletzt immer, und sei es unter der\ngeistigsten Maskerade, und vielleicht ohne dass sie selbst es wissen,\nzu raffinirten Rachsüchtigen und Giftmischem (man grabe doch einmal\nden Grund der Ethik und Theologie Spinoza's auf!) - gar nicht\nzu reden von der Tölpelei der morahschen Entrüstung, welche an\neinem Philosophen das unfehlbare Zeichen dafür ist, dass ihm der\nphilosophische Humor davon hef. Das Martyrium des Philosophen, seine\n\"Aufopferung für die Wahrheit\" zwingt an's Licht heraus, was vom\nAgitator und vom Schauspieler in ihm steckte; und gesetzt, dass man\nihm nur mit einer artistischen Neugierde bisher zugeschaut hat, so\nkann in Bezug auf manchen Philosophen der gefährhche Wunsch freihch\nbegreifhch sein, ihn auch einmal in seiner Entartung zu sehn\n(entartet zum \"Märtyrer\", zum Bühnen- und Tribünen-Schreihals). Nur\ndass man sich, mit einem solchen Wunsche, darüber klar sein muss, was\nman jedenfalls dabei zu sehen bekommen wird: - nur ein Satyrspiel, nur\neine Nachspiel-Farce, nur den fortwährenden Beweis dafür, dass die\nlange eigenthche Tragödie zu Ende ist: vorausgesetzt, dass jede\nPhilosophie im Entstehen eine lange Tragödie war. -",
    "Kaufmann": "After such a cheerful commencement, a serious word would \nhke to be heard; it appeals to the most serious, Take care, philosophers and friends, of knowledge, and beware of martyrdom!

It \nSpoils all the innocence and fine neutrahty of your conscience; it \nmakes you headstrong against objections and red rags; it stupefies, \nanimahzes, and brutahzes when in the struggle with danger, slander, \nsuspicion, expulsion, and even worse consequences of hostihty, you \nhave to pose as protectors of truth upon earth—as though “the \ntruth” were such an innocuous and incompetent creature as to require protectors! and you of all people, you knights of the most sorrowful countenance,? dear loafers and cobweb-spinners of the \nspirit! After all, you know well enough that it cannot be of any consequence if you of all people are proved right; you know that no \nphilosopher so far has been proved right, and that there might be a \nmore laudable truthfulness in every httle question mark that you \n\n\nplace after your special words and favorite doctrines (and occasionally after yourselves) than in all the solemn gestures and \ntrumps before accusers and law courts.® Rather, go away. Fles into \nconcealment. And have your masks and subtlety,‘ that you may be \nmistaken for what you are not, or feared a httle. And don’t forget \nthe garden, the garden with golden trelhswork. And have people \naround you who are as a garden—or as music on the waters in the \nevening, when the day is tuming into memories, Choose the good \nsohtude, the free, playful, light sohtude that gives you, too, the right \nto remain good in some sense. How poisonous, how crafty, how \nbad, does every long war make one, that cannot be waged openly \nby means of force! How personal does a long fear make one, a \nlong watching of enemies, of possible enemies!

    "Hollingdale": "After so cheerful an exordium a serious word would hke to be heard: it addresses \nitself to the most serious. Take care, philosophers and friends of knowledge, and \nbeware of martyrdom! Of suffering ‘for the sake of truth’! Even of defending \nyourselves! It spoils all the innocence and fine neutrahty of your conscience, it \nmakes you obstinate against rebuffs and red rags, it makes you stupid, brutal and \nbulhsh if in the struggle with danger, slander, suspicion, casting out and even \ngrosser consequences of hostihty you finally even have to act as defenders of truth \non earth — as if ‘truth’ were so innocuous and inept a person she stood in need of \ndefending! And precisely by you, you knights of most sorrowful countenance, you \nidlers and cobweb-spinners of the spirit! After all, you know well enough that it \ncannot matter in the least whether precisely you are in the right, just as no \nphilosopher hitherto has been in the right, and that a more praiseworthy veracity \nmay he in every httle question-mark placed after your favourite words and favourite \ntheories (and occasionally after yourselves) than in all your solemn gesticulations \nand smart answers before courts and accusers! Better to step aside! Flee away and \nconceal yourselves! And have your masks and subtlety, so that you may be \nmisunderstood! Or feared a httle! And do not forget the garden, the garden with \ngolden trelhs-work. And have about you people who are hke a garden — or hke \nmusic on the waters in the evening, when the day is already becoming a memory; — \nchoose the good sohtude, the free, wanton, easy sohtude which gives you too a right \nto remain in some sense good! How poisonous, how cunning, how bad every \nprotracted war makes one when it cannot be waged with open force! How personal \na protracted fear makes one, a protracted keeping watch for enemies, for possible \nenemies! These outcasts of society, long persecuted and sorely hunted — also the \nenforced recluses, the Spinozas and Giordano Brunos — in the end always become \nrefined vengeance-seekers and brewers of poison, even if they do so under the most \nspiritual masquerade and perhaps without being themselves aware of it (just dig up \nthe foundation of Spinoza's ethics and theology!) — not to speak of the stupidity of \nmoral indignation, which is in the philosopher an unfaihng sign that he has lost his \nphilosophical sense of humour. The martyrdom of the philosopher, his ‘sacrifice for \ntruth’, brings to light what there has been in him of agitator and actor; and if one \nhas hitherto regarded him only with artistic curiosity, in the case of many a \nphilosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous desire to see him for once in his \ndegeneration (degenerated into ‘martyr’, into stage- and platform-ranter). But if one \n\n\ndoes harbour such a desire, one has to be clear what it is one will get to see — \nmerely a satyr play, merely a farcical after-piece, merely a continuing proof that the \nlong tragedy has come to an end: supposing that every philosophy was in its \ninception a long tragedy. —",
    "Norman": "well-invented, well-falsified world, how unwilhngly wilhng science loves \nerror because, being alive, — it loves life!",
    "Faber": "After such a light-hearted introduction, it is time to attend to a \nserious word, one that is addressed to the most serious of people. \nBe on guard, all you philosophers and lovers of knowledge, and \n26 Beyond Good and Evil \nbeware of tuming into martyrs! Beware of suffering ‘for the sake \nof truth’! Beware even of defending yourselves! You will ruin all \nthe innocence and fine objectivity of your conscience; you will \nbecome obstinate in the face of objections and red rags; you \n\n\nwill grow stupid, brutish, and bulhsh if in your fight against danger, \ndefamation, accusations, expulsion, and even baser consequences \nof enmity you will ultimately have to play the role of defenders of \ntruth on carth as well: as if ‘truth’ were such a meek and hapless \nwoman as to need defenders! And especially such as you, gentlemen, \nyou knights of the most sorrowful countenance,* you intellectual \nidlers and cobweb-spinners! In the end you know very well that it \ndoes not matter whether you are proved right, and hkewise that no \nphilosopher to date has been proved right, and that there is probably \nmore value for truth in every httle question mark that you place at \nthe end of your mottoes and favourite doctrines (and occasionally \nafter your own selves) than in all your dignified gestures and your \nplaying the trump before plaintiffs and lawcourts! Take the side \nexit instead! Flee to hidden spaces! And wear your mask and your \nsubtlety so that people will not be able to tell you apart! Or will \nfear you a httle! And please don’t forget the garden, the garden \nwith the golden trelhses! And keep people around you who are hke \na garden——er hke music over the waters at that evening hour when \nday is already tuming into memory: choose the good sohtude, the \nfree, wanton, weightless sohtude that also gives you the right to \nremain good, in some sense at least. How venomous, how wily, how \nbad one becomes in every long war that cannot be waged in the \nopen! How personal one becomes by holding fears for a long time, \nby watching long for enemies, possible enemies! Despite their most \nspiritual disguises and perhaps without even knowing it, these \noutcasts of society, these long-term fugitives, hunters’ prey—and \nalso the enforced hermits, the Spinozas or Giordano Brunos*— \nalways end by becoming elegant avengers and poisoners (just excavate the foundation of Spinoza’s ethics and theology!)—not to \nmention the foolish moral indignation that is the unfaihng sign of \na philosopher whose philosophical humour has deserted him. The \nphilosopher’s martyrdom, his ‘sacrifice for truth’, forces into the \nlight whatever was lurking in him of the propagandist and the actor; \nand if it is true that people have regarded him with only an artistic \ncuriosity until now, we can certainly understand why they would \nThe Free Spirit 27 \nhave the dangerous wish to see him in his degeneracy for once \n(degenerated to a ‘martyr’, to a playhouse and courthouse ranter). \nWhen we make such a wish, however, we have to be clear what it \nis that we will get to see: merely a satyr play, merely a farcical \nepilogue, merely the continuing proof that the actual, long tragedy \nis over—assuming that every philosophy, as it was taking shape, was \none long tragedy.—",
