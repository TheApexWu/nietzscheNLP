    "Gutenberg": "Es dämmert jetzt vielleicht in fünf, sechs Köpfen, dass Physik auch\nnur eine Welt-Auslegung und -Zurechtlegung (nach uns! mit Verlaub\ngesagt) und nicht eine Welt-Erklärung ist: aber, insofem sie sich auf\nden Glauben an die Sinne stellt, gilt sie als mehr und muss auf lange\nhinaus noch als mehr, nämhch als Erklärung gelten. Sie hat Augen und\nFinger für sich, sie hat den Augenschein und die Handgreifhchkeit\nfür sich: das wirkt auf ein Zeitalter mit plebejischem Grundgeschmack\nbezaubemd, überredend, überzeugend, - es folgt ja instinktiv dem\nWahrheits-Kanon des ewig volksthümhchen Sensuahsmus. Was ist klar,\nwas \"erklärt\"? Erst Das, was sich sehen und tasten lässt, - bis so\nweit muss man jedes Problem treiben. Umgekehrt: genau im Widerstreben\ngegen die Sinnenfälhgkeit bestand der Zauber der platonischen\nDenkweise, welche eine vornehme Denkweise war, - vielleicht unter\nMenschen, die sich sogar stärkerer und anspruchsvollerer Sinne\nerfreuten, als unsre Zeitgenossen sie haben, aber welche einen höheren\nTriumph darin zu finden wussten, über diese Sinne Herr zu bleiben: und\ndies mittels blasser kalter grauer Begriffs-Netze, die sie über den\nbunten Sinnen-Wirbel - den Sinnen-Pöbel, wie Plato sagte - warfen.\nEs war eine andre Art Genuss in dieser Welt-Überwältigung und\nWelt-Auslegung nach der Manier des Plato, als der es ist, welchen\nuns die Physiker von Heute anbieten, insgleichen die Darwinisten und\n\nAntitheologen unter den physiologischen Arbeitem, mit ihrem Princip\nder \"kleinstmöghchen Kraft\" und der grösstmöghchen Dummheit. \"Wo der\nMensch nichts mehr zu sehen und zu greifen hat, da hat er auch nichts\nmehr zu suchen\" - das ist freihch ein anderer Imperativ als der\nPlatonische, welcher aber doch für ein derbes arbeitsames Geschlecht\nvon Maschinisten und Brückenbauem der Zukunft, die lauter grobe\nArbeit abzuthun haben, gerade der rechte Imperativ sein mag.",
    "Kaufmann": "It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that physics, \ntoo, is only an interpretation and exegesis of the world (to suit us, if \nI may say so!) and not a world-explanation; but insofar as it is \nan equivalent of the German Afekt, which is defined as “passing emotional \nstates . . . The best writera distinguish it from passion, as having less vehe~ \nmence, and as less distinctly, if at all, connected with a sensuous basis, . . . \nSt. Augustine, as quoted and adopted by Aquinas, says: ‘Those mental \n\n\nstates (motus animi} which the Greeks call pathé, and Cicero perturbationes, are by some called affectus, or affectiones by others, keeping to the \nhterat rendering of the Greek passiones’ ” \nMy reason for preferring “affect” to “affection” is that the former is readily recognized us a technical term, while the latter is very apt to be misunderstood as suggesting a mild form of Jove. \na Nietzsche admired Spinoza for, among other things, his critique of tele» \nology. \n22 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nbased on belief in the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a long \ntime to come must be regarded as more—namely, as an explanation. Eyes and fingers speak in its favor, visual evidence and palpableness do, too: this strikes an age with fundamentally plebeian \ntastes as fascinating, persuasive, and convincing—after all, it follows instinctively the canon of truth of etemally popular sensuahsm. What is clear, what is “explained”? Only what can be seen \nand felt—every problem has to be pursued to that point. Conversely, the charm of the Platonic way of thinking, which was a noble way of thinking, consisted precisely in resistance to obvious \nsense-evidence—perhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger \nand more demanding senses than our contemporaries, but who \nknew how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters of their \nsenses—and this by means of pale, cold, gray concept nets which \nthey threw over the motley whirl of the senses—the mob of the \nsenses, as Plato said. In this overcoming of the world, and interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato, there was an enjoyment \ndifferent from that which the physicists of today offer us—and also \nthe Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the workers in physiology, with their principle of the “smallest possible force” and the \ngreatest possible stupidity. “Where man cannot find anything to see \nor to grasp, he has no further business”—that is certainly an imperative different from the Platonic one, but it may be the right imperative for a tough, industrious race of machinists and bridgebuilders of the future, who have nothing but rough work to do.",
    "Hollingdale": "It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that physics too is only an \ninterpretation and arrangement of the world (according to our own requirements, if \nI may say so!) and not an explanation of the world: but in so far as it is founded on \nbelief in the senses it passes for more than that and must continue to do so for a \nlong time to come. It has the eyes and the hands on its side, it has ocular evidence \nand palpabihty on its side: and this has the effect of fascinating, persuading, \nconvincing an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes — for it instinctively follows \nthe canon of etemal, popular sensuahsm. What is obvious, what has been \n‘explained’? Only that which can be seen and felt — thus far has every problem to be \nscrutinized. Obversely: it was precisely in opposition to palpabihty that the charm \nof the Platonic mode of thinking, which was a noble mode of thinking, consisted — \non the part of men who perhaps rejoiced in even stronger and more exacting senses \nthan our contemporaries possess, but who knew how to experience a greater \ntriumph in mastering them: which they did by means of pale, cold, grey conceptual \nnets thrown over the motley whirl of the senses — the mob of the senses, as Plato \ncalled them. This overcoming and interpretation of the world in the manner of \nPlato involved a kind of enjoyment different from that which the physicists of today \noffer us, or from that offered us by the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the \nlabourers in physiology, with their principle of the ‘smallest possible effort’ and the\ngreatest possible stupidity. “Where man has nothing more to see or grasp he has \nnothing more to do’ — that is certainly a different imperative from the Platonic, but \nfor an uncouth industrious race of machinists and bridge-builders of the future, \nwhich has nothing but course work to get through, it may well be the right one.",
    "Norman": "old psychologists might have found things easier and more enjoyable —: \nbut, in the end, the new psychologist knows by this very token that he is \ncondemned to invention — and, who knows? perhaps to discovery.'? —",
    "Faber": "It now may be dawning on five or six thinkers that even physics is \nonly a way of interpreting or arranging the world (if I may say so: \naccording to us!) and not a way of explaining the world. But in so \nfar as it rehes on our belief in the senses, physics is taken for more \nthan that, and shall long continue to be taken for more, for an \nexplanation. Our eyes and fingers speak for it, appearance and \n\n\npalpabihty speak for it: to an era with essentially plebeian tastes \nthis is enchanting, persuasive, convincing, for it instinctively follows \nthe canonized truth of ever-popular sensuahsm. What is clear, what \n‘clarifies’? First, whatever can be seen and touched—you have to \ntake every problem at least that far. Conversely, the magic of the \nPlatonic method consisted precisely in its resistance to sensuality, \nfor this was an aristocratic method, practised by people who may \nhave enjoyed senses even stronger and more clamorous than those \nof our contemporaries, but who sought a higher triumph by mastering them, by tossing over this colourful confusion of the senses \n(the rabble of the senses, as Plato called it) the pale, cold, grey nets \nof concepts. There was a kind of enjoyment in Plato’s manner of \n16 Beyond Good and Evil \noverpowering and interpreting the world different from the one \ncurrently offered us by physicists, including those Darwinists and \nanti-teleologists among the physiological workers with their principle of the ‘least possible energy’* and the greatest possible \nstupidity. ‘Where man has nothing more to sce and grasp, he has \nnothing more to seck’—that imperative certainly differs from \nPlato’s, but it may be exactly right for a hardy, industrious future \nrace of machinists and bridge-builders who have only dirty work \nto do.",
    "Zimmern": "It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that nat~ \nural philosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement (according to us, if I may say so!) and not a \nworld-explanation; but in so far as it is based on belief in \nthe senses, it is regarded as more, and for a long time to \ncome must be regarded as more — namely, as an explanation. \nIt has eyes and fingers of its own, it has ocular evidence \nand palpableness of its own: this operates fascinatingly, persuasively, and convincingly upon an age with fundamentally \nplebeian tastes — in fact, it follows instinctively the canon \nof truth of etemal popular sensuahsm. \"What is clear, what \nis \"explained\"? Only that which can be seen and felt — one \nmust pursue every problem thus far. Obversely, however, \nthe charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an \naristocratic mode, consisted precisely in resistance to obvious \nsense-evidence — perhaps among men who enjoyed even \nstronger and more fastidious senses than our contemporaries, \nbut who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining \nmasters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional networks which they threw over the motley whirl \nof the senses — the mob of the senses, as Plato said. In this \novercoming of the world, and interpreting of the world in \nthe manner of Plato, there was an enjoyment different from \nthat which the physicists of to-day offer us — and hkewise \nthe Darwinists and antiteleologists among the physiological \n1 6 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nworkers, with their principle of the \"smallest possible effort,\" \nand the greatest possible blunder. \"Where there is nothing \nmore to see or to grasp, there is also nothing more for men \nto do\" — that is certainly an imperative different from the \nPlatonic one, but it may notwithstanding be the right imperative for a hardy, labourious race of machinists and \nbridge-builders of the future, who have nothing but rough \nwork to perform. \nIS \nTo study physiology with a clear conscience, one must \ninsist on the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in \nthe sense of the ideahstic philosophy; as such they certainly \ncould not be causes! Sensuahsm, therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis, if not as heuristic principle. What? And \n\n\nothers say even that the extemal world is the work of our \norgans? But then our body, as a part of this extemal world, \nwould be the work of our organs! But then our organs \nthemselves would be the work of our organs! It seems to \nme that this is a complete reductio ad absurdum, if the conception causa sui is something fundamentally absurd. Consequently, the extemal world is not the work of our organs — ? \ni6 \nThere are still harmless self-observers who believe that \nthere are \"immediate certainties\"; for instance, \"I think,\" \nor as the superstition of Schopenhauer puts it, \"I will\"; as \nthough cognition here got hold of its object purely and simply \nas \"the thing in itself,\" without any falsification taking place \neither on the part of the subject or the object. I would \nrepeat it, however, a hundred times, that \"immediate cerBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 17 \ntainty,\" as well as \"absolute knowledge\" and the \"thing in \nitself,\" involve a contradictio in adjecto; we really ought to \nfree ourselves from the misleading significance of words! \nThe people on their part may think that cognition is knowing \nall about things, but the philosopher must say to himself: \n\"When I analyse the process that is expressed in the sentence, 'I think,' I find a whole series of daring assertions, the \nargumentative proof of which would be difficult, perhaps \nimpossible: for instance, that it is / who think, that there \nmust necessarily be something that thinks, that thinking is \nan activity and operation on the part of a being who is \nthought of as a cause, that there is an 'ego,' and finally, that \nit is already determined what is to be designated by thinking \n— that I know what thinking is. For if I had not already \ndecided within myself what it is, by what standard could I \ndetermine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps \n'wilhng' or 'feehng'? In short, the assertion 'I think,' assumes that I compare my state at the present moment with \nother states of myself which I know, in order to determine \nwhat it is; on accoimt of this retrospective connection with \nfurther 'knowledge,' it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for me.\" — In place of the \"immediate certainty\" in \nwhich the people may believe in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a series of ^netaphysical questions presented \nto him, veritable conscience questions of the intellect, to wit: \n\"From whence did I get the notion of 'thinking'? Why do \nI believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right to \nspeak of an 'ego,' and even of an 'ego' as cause, and finally \nof an 'ego' as cause of thought?\" He who ventures to answer these metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to \na sort of intuitive perception, hke the person who says, \"I \nthink, and know that this, at least, is true, actual, and certain\"— will encounter a smile and two notes of interrogation \n1 8 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nin a philosopher nowadays. \"Sir,\" the philosopher' will perhaps give him to understand, \"it is improbable that you are \nnot mistaken, but why should it be the truth?\""
