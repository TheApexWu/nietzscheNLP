    "Gutenberg": "Eine neue Gattung von Philosophen kommt herauf: ich wage es, sie auf\neinen nicht ungefährhchen Namen zu taufen. So wie ich sie errathe,\nso wie sie sich errathen lassen - denn es gehört zu ihrer Art, irgend\nworin Räthsel bleiben zu wollen -, möchten diese Philosophen der\nZukunft ein Recht, vielleicht auch ein Unrecht darauf haben, als\nVersucher bezeichnet zu werden. Dieser Name selbst ist zuletzt nur ein\nVersuch, und, wenn man will, eine Versuchung.",
    "Kaufmann": "A new species of philosophers is coming up: I venture to baptize them with a name that is not free of danger. As I unriddle \nthem, insofar as they allow themselves to be unriddled—for it belongs to their nature to want to remain riddles at some point-—these philosophers of the future may have a right—it might also be \na wrong-—to be called attempters.” This name itself is in the end a \nmere attempt and, if you will, a temptation. — \n23 Winkel has been translated here and elsewhere as “nook”; but it can \nalso mean angle, which would make sense here though not in many of the \nother passages, \n24 This might be an allusion to Richard Wagner; but this is a point Nietzsche considered important generally, and it is developed at length in Part IV \nof Zarathustra, \n25 In German usage, classical philology, which Nietzsche had given up in \norder to devote himself entirely to his own writing, is a science. \n26 Versucher could also mean tempters (which does not seem intended here, \nTHE FREE SPIRIT 33",
    "Hollingdale": "A new species of philosopher is appearing: I venture to baptize these philosophers \nwith a name not without danger in it. As I divine them, as they let themselves be \ndivined — for it pertains to their nature to want to remain a riddle in some respects —\nthese philosophers of the future might rightly, but perhaps also wrongly, be \ndescribed as attempters. This name itself is in the end only an attempt and, if you \nwill, a temptation.",
    "Norman": "A new breed of philosophers is approaching. I will risk christening them \nwith a name not lacking in dangers. From what I can guess about them, \nfrom what they allow to be guessed (since it is typical of them to want to \nremain riddles in some respect), these philosophers of the future might \nhave the right (and perhaps also the wrong) to be described as those who \nattempt. ^ Ultimately, this name is itself only an attempt, and, if you will, \na temptation. \n16 In German: Versucher. Nietzsche frequently uses the terms Versuch (attempt or experi\nVersuchung (temptation), and plays on their similarity.",
    "Faber": "A new category of philosophers is on the rise: I shall be so bold as \nto christen them with a name that is not without its dangers. As I \ndivine them, as they allow themselves to be divined (for it is part \nof their nature to want to remain a riddle in some respects), these \nphilosophers of the future might rightfully—perhaps also wrongfully—be described as experimenters. And this name too is ultimately \nonly an experiment, and, if you hke, a temptation.* \n40 Beyond Good and Evil",
