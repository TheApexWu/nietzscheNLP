    "Gutenberg": "Wie boshaft Philosophen sein können! Ich kenne nichts Giftigeres als\nden Scherz, den sich Epicur gegen Plato und die Platoniker erlaubte:\ner nannte sie Dionysiokolakes. Das bedeutet dem Wortlaute nach und im\nVordergrunde \"Schmeichler des Dionysios\", also Tyrannen-Zubehör und\nSpeichellecker; zu alledem will es aber noch sagen \"das sind Alles\nSchauspieler, daran ist nichts Ächtes\" (denn Dionysokolax war eine\npopuläre Bezeichnung des Schauspielers). Und das Letztere ist\neigenthch die Bosheit, welche Epicur gegen Plato abschoss: ihn\nverdross die grossartige Manier, das Sich-in-Scene-Setzen, worauf\nsich Plato sammt seinen Schülem verstand, - worauf sich Epicur nicht\nverstand! er, der alte Schulmeister von Samos, der in seinem Gärtchen\nzu Athen versteckt sass und dreihundert Bücher schrieb, wer weiss?\nvielleicht aus Wuth und Ehrgeiz gegen Plato? - Es brauchte hundert\nJahre, bis Griechenland dahinter kam, wer dieser Gartengott Epicur\ngewesen war. - Kam es dahinter? -",
    "Kaufmann": "How mahcious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more \nvenomous than the joke Epicurus permitted himself against Plato \nand the Platonists; he called them Dionysiokolakes. That means \nhterally—and this is the foreground meaning—\"fatterers of Dionysius,” in other words, tyrant’s baggage and hckspittles; but in \naddition to this he also wants to say, “they are all actors, there is \n\n\nnothing genuine about them” (for Dionysokolax was a popular \nname for an actor).® And the latter is really the-mahce that Epicurus aimed at Plato: he was peeved by the grandiose manner, the \nmise en scéne® at which Plato and his disciples were so expert—at \nT Nietzsche is thinking of the “great” philosophers. Now that there are Jiterally thousands of “philosophers,” these tend to be more akin to their col» \nleagues In other departments than to the men discussed here, \n8 The reference ts to Epicurus’ fragment 238, and the ambiguity is due to \nthe fact that ie fae was the name of the Sicihan tyrant whom Plato \nhad tried for several years to convert to his own philosophy, \n9 Staging, \nON THE PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS 15 \nwhich Epicurus was not an expert—he, that old schoolmaster from \nSamos, who sat, hidden away, in his httle garden at Athens and \nwrote three hundred books—who knows? perhaps from rage and \nambition against Plato? \nIt took a hundred years until Greece found out who this gare \nden god, Epicurus, had been.—- Did they find out?—",
    "Hollingdale": "How mahcious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more venomous than the \njoke Epicurus allowed himself to make against Plato and the Platonists: he called \nthem Dionysiokolakes. The hteral and foreground meaning of this word is ‘flatterers \nof Dionysus’, that is to say, tyrants' hangers-on and hckspittles; in addition, \nhowever, it is as much as to say ‘they are all actors, there is nothing genuine about \nthem’ (for Dionysiokolax was a popular term for an actor). And the latter meaning is \nreally the piece of mahce that Epicurus discharged at Plato: he was annoyed by the \ngrandiose manner, the mise en scéne of which Plato and his pupils were masters — \nof which Epicurus was not a master! He, the old schoolteacher from Samos who sat \nhidden in his httle garden at Athens and wrote three hundred books — who knows, \nperhaps out of rage at Plato and ambitious envy of him? — It took a century for \nGreece to find out who this garden god Epicurus had been. — Did it find out? —",
    "Norman": "How mahcious philosophers can be! I do not know anything more venomous than the joke Epicurus allowed himself against Plato and the \nPlatonists: he called them Dionysiokolakes.* Literally, the foreground \nmeaning of this term is “sycophants of Dionysus” and therefore accessories of the tyrant and brown-nosers; but it also wants to say “they’re \nall actors, there’s nothing genuine about them” (since Dionysokolax was a \npopular term for an actor). And this second meaning is really the mahce \nthat Epicurus hurled against Plato: he was annoyed by the magnificent \nstyle, the mise-en-scène that Plato and his students were so good at, — that \nEpicurus was not so good at! He, the old schoolmaster from Samos, who \nsat hidden in his httle garden in Athens and wrote three hundred books, \n* Epicurus, Fragment 93. \nBeyond Good and Evil \nwho knows? perhaps out of anger and ambition against Plato? — It took a \nhundred years for Greece to find out who this garden god Epicurus had \nbeen. — Did it find out?",
    "Faber": "How mahcious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more venomous than the joke that Epicurus* made at the expense of Plato \nand the Platonists: he called them ‘Dionysiokolakes’. Literally and \nprimarily, this means ‘flatterers of Dionysus’, that is, the tyrant’s \nappendages and toadies; but it also suggests: “They are all actors, \nthere is nothing genuine about them’ (for ‘Bionysiokolax’ was a \npopular term for an actor). And the latter meaning contains the \nreal mahce that Epicurus fired off at Plato: he was annoyed by \nthe mannered grandiosity, the theatricahty that Plato and his pupils \n10 Beyond Good and Evil \ndeployed so well, and that Epicurus did not! Epicurus, the old \nschoolmaster of Samos, sat tucked away in his httle garden in \nAthens and wrote three hundred books—out of fury and ambition \nagainst Plato—who knows? \nIt took one hundred years for Greece to reahze who this gardengod Epicurus had been. \nDid it reahze?",
