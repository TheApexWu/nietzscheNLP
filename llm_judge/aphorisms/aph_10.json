    "Gutenberg": "Der Eifer und die Feinheit, ich möchte sogar sagen: Schlauheit, mit\ndenen man heute überall in Europa dem Probleme \"von der wirkhchen\nund der scheinbaren Welt\" auf den Leib rückt, giebt zu denken und zu\nhorchen; und wer hier im Hintergrunde nur einen \"Willen zur Wahrheit\"\nund nichts weiter hört, erfreut sich gewiss nicht der schärfsten\nOhren. In einzelnen und seltenen Fällen mag wirkhch ein solcher Wille\nzur Wahrheit, irgend ein ausschweifender und abenteuemder Muth, ein\nMetaphysiker-Ehrgeiz des verlomen Postens dabei betheihgt sein, der\nzuletzt eine Handvoll \"Gewissheit\" immer noch einem ganzen Wagen voll\nschöner Möghchkeiten vorzieht; es mag sogar puritanische Fanatiker\ndes Gewissens geben, welche heber noch sich auf ein sicheres Nichts\nals auf ein ungewisses Etwas sterben legen. Aber dies ist Nihihsmus\nund Anzeichen einer verzweifelnden sterbensmüden Seele: wie tapfer\nauch die Gebärden einer solchen Tugend sich ausnehmen mögen. Bei den\nstärkeren, lebensvolleren, nach Leben noch durstigen Denkem scheint\nes aber anders zu stehen: indem sie Partei gegen den Schein nehmen und\ndas Wort \"perspektivisch\" bereits mit Hochmuth aussprechen, indem sie\ndie Glaubwürdigkeit ihres eigenen Leibes ungefähr so gering anschlagen\nwie die Glaubwürdigkeit des Augenscheins, welcher sagt \"die Erde steht\nstill\", und dermaassen anscheinend gut gelaunt den sichersten Besitz\naus den Händen lassen (denn was glaubt man jetzt sicherer als seinen\nLeib?) wer weiss, ob sie nicht im Grunde Etwas zurückerobem wollen,\ndas man ehemals noch sicherer besessen hat, irgend Etwas vom alten\nGrundbesitz des Glaubens von Ehedem, vielleicht \"die unsterbhche\nSeele\", vielleicht \"den alten Gott\", kurz, Ideen, auf welchen sich\nbesser, nämhch kräftiger und heiterer leben hess als auf den\n\"modemen Ideen\"? Es ist Misstrauen gegen diese modemen Ideen darin,\nes ist Unglauben an alles Das, was gestem und heute gebaut worden\nist; es ist vielleicht ein leichter Überdruss und Hohn eingemischt,\nder das bric-à-brac von Begriffen verschiedenster Abkunft nicht\nmehr aushält, als welches sich heute der sogenannte Positivismus\nauf den Markt bringt, ein Ekel des verwöhnteren Geschmacks\nvor der Jahrmarkts-Buntheit und Lappenhaftigkeit aller dieser\nWirkhchkeits-Philosophaster, an denen nichts neu und ächt ist als\ndiese Buntheit. Man soll darin, wie mich dünkt, diesen skeptischen\nAnti-Wirkhchen und Erkenntniss-Mikroskopikem von heute Recht geben:\nihr Instinkt, welcher sie aus der modemen Wirkhchkeit hinwegtreibt,\nist unwiderlegt, - was gehen uns ihre rückläufigen Schleichwege an!\nDas Wesenthche an ihnen ist nicht, dass sie \"zurück\" wollen: sondem,\ndass sie - weg wollen. Etwas Kraft, Flug, Muth, Künstlerschaft mehr\nund sie würden hinaus wollen, - und nicht zurück! -",

The main thing about them is nolA \nthat they wish to go \"back,\" but that they wish to get ca^cy \ntherefrom. A httle more strength, swing, courage, and \nartistic power, and they would be o§ — and not back! \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL ii \nI \nIX \nIt seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at \npresent to divert attention from the actual influence which \nKant exercised on German philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon himself. Kant \n\n\nwas first and foremost proud of his Table of Categories; \nwith it in his hand he said: \"This is the most difficult thing \nthat could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.\" \nLet us only understand this \"could be\"! He was proud of \nhaving discovered a new faculty in man, the faculty of \nsynthetic judgment a priori. Granting that he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid flourishing \nof German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, \nand on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible something — at all events \"new faculties\" — \nof which to be still prouder! — But let us reflect for a \nmoment — it is high time to do so. \"How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?\" Kant asks himself — and what is \nreally his answer? \"By means of a means (faculty)\" — ^but \nunfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly, and with such display of German profimdity and \nverbal flourishes, that one altogether loses sight of the \ncomical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer. People were beside themselves with delight over this new fac^ ulty, and the jubilation reached its chmeix v/hen Kant further \ndiscovered a moral faculty in man — for at that time Germans \nwere still moral, not yet dabbhng in the \"Pohtics of hard \nfact.\" Then came the honeymoon of German philosophy. \nAll the young theologians of the Tiibingen institution went \nI mmediately into the groves — all seeking for \"faculties.\" \njri .tod what did they not find — in that innocent, rich, and still \nII \n12 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nyouthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, \nthe mahcious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet \ndistinguish between \"finding\" and \"inventing\"! Above all \na faculty for the \"transcendental\"; Schelhng christened it, \nintellectual intuition, and thereby gratified the most eamest \nlongings of the naturally pious-inclined Germans. One can \ndo no greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness, notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly in hoary and senile \nconceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with \nmoral indignation. Enough, however — the world grew older, \nand the dream vanished. A time came when people rubbed \ntheir foreheads, and they still rub them to-day. People had \nbeen dreaming, and first and foremost — old Kant. \"By \nmeans of a means (faculty)\" — he had said, or at least meant \nto say. But, is that — an answer? An explanation? Or \n\n\nis it not rather merely a repetition of the question? How \ndoes opium induce sleep? \"By means of a means (faculty),\" \nnamely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in Mohere, \nQuia est in eo virtus dormitiva, \nCujus est natura sensus assoupire. \nBut such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is \nhigh time to replace the Kantian question, \"How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?\" by another question, \n\"Why is belief in such judgments necessary?\" — in effect, it \nhigh time that we should imderstand that such judgments, \nmust be believed to be true, for the sake of the preservation of creatures hke ourselves; though they still might] \nnaturally be false judgments! Or, more plainly spokeUjj \nand roughly and readily — synthetic judgments a priori shoulc \nnot \"be possible\" at all; we have no right to them; in oui \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 13 \nmouths they are nothing but false judgments). Only, of \ncourse, the belief in their truth is necessary, as plausible \nbelief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view \nof life. And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence \nwhich \"German philosophy\" — I hope you understand its \nright to inverted commas (gooseteet)? — has exercised \nthroughout the whole of Europe, there is no doubt that a \ncertain virtus dormitiva had a share in it; thanks to German \nphilosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous, \nthe mystics, the artists, the three- fourths Christians, and the \npohtical obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to \nthe still overwhelming sensuahsm which overflowed from \nthe last century into this, in short — \"sensus assoupire.\" . . . \ny2 \nAs regards materiahstic atomism, it is one of the best \nrefuted theories that have been advanced, and in Europe \nthere is now perhaps no one in the leamed world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it, except for \nconvenient everyday use (as an abbreviation of the means \nof expression) — thanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he \nand the Pole Copemicus have hitherto been the greatest and \nmost successful opponents of ocular evidence. For whilst \nCopemicus has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the \nsenses, that the earth does not stand fast, Boscovich has \ntaught us to abjure the belief in the last thing that \"stood \n\n\nfast\" of the earth — the belief in \"substance,\" in \"matter,\" \nin the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest \ntriumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on \nearth. One must, however, go still further, and also declare \nwar, relentless war to the knife, against the \"atomistic requirements\" which still lead a dangerous after-life in places \n14 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nwhere no one suspects them, hke the more celebrated \"metaphysical requirements\": one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism \nwhich Christianity has taught best and longest, the soulatomism. Let it be permitted to designate by this expression \nthe belief which regards the soul as something indestructible, \netemal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief \nought to be expelled from science! Between ourselves, it is \nnot at all necessary to get rid of \"the soul\" thereby, and thus \nrenounce one of the oldest and most venerated hj^otheses — \nas happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturahsts, who \ncan hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it. \nBut the way is open for new acceptations and refinements of \nthe soul-hypothesis; and such conceptions as \"mortal soul,\" \nand \"soul of subjective multiphcity,\" and \"soul as social \nstructure of the instincts and passions,\" want henceforth to \nhave legitimate rights in science. In that the new psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have \nhitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the \nidea of the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into \na new desert and a new distrust — it is possible that the older \npsychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of \nit; eventually, however, he finds that precisely thereby he \nis also condemned to invent — and, who knows? perhaps to \ndiscover the new."
