    "Gutenberg": "Der Wille zur Wahrheit, der uns noch zu manchem Wagnisse verführen\nwird, jene berühmte Wahrhaftigkeit, von der alle Philosophen bisher\nmit Ehrerbietung geredet haben: was für Fragen hat dieser Wille\nzur Wahrheit uns schon vorgelegt! Welche wunderhchen schhmmen\nfragwürdigen Fragen! Das ist bereits eine lange Geschichte, - und\ndoch scheint es, dass sie kaum eben angefangen hat? Was Wunder, wenn\nwir endhch einmal misstrauisch werden, die Geduld verheren, uns\nungeduldig umdrehn? Dass wir von dieser Sphinx auch unserseits das\nFragen lemen? Wer ist das eigenthch, der uns hier Fragen stellt?\nWas in uns will eigenthch \"zur Wahrheit\"? - In der that, wir machten\nlangen Halt vor der Frage nach der Ursache dieses Willens, - bis\nwir, zuletzt, vor einer noch gründhcheren Frage ganz und gar stehen\nbheben. Wir fragten nach dem Werthe dieses Willens. Gesetzt, wir\nwollen Wahrheit: warum nicht heber Unwahrheit? Und Ungewissheit?\nSelbst Unwissenheit? - Das Problem vom Werthe der Wahrheit trat vor\nuns hin, - oder waren wir's, die vor das Problem hin traten? Wer von\nuns ist hier Oedipus? Wer Sphinx? Es ist ein Stelldichein, wie es\nscheint, von Fragen und Fragezeichen. - Und sollte man's glauben, dass\nes uns schhesshch bedünken will, als sei das Problem noch nie bisher\ngestellt, - als sei es von uns zum ersten Male gesehn, in's Auge\ngefasst, gewagt? Denn es ist ein Wagnis dabei, und vielleicht giebt es\nkein grösseres.",
    "Kaufmann": "The will to truth which will still tempt us to many a venture, that \nfamous truthfulness of which all philosophers so far have spoken \nwith respect—what questions has this will to truth not laid before \nus! What strange, wicked, questionable questions! That is a long \nstory even now—and yet it seems as if it had scarcely begun. Is it \nany wonder that we should finally become suspicious, lose patience, and tum away impatiently? that we should finally leam \nfrom this Sphinx to ask questions, too? Who is it really that puts \nquestions to us here? What in us really wants “truth”? \nIndeed we came to a long halt at the question about the cause \nof this will—until we finally came to a complete stop before a still \nmore basic question. We asked about the value of this will. Suppose \nwe want truth: why not rather untruth? and uncertainty? even ignorance? \nThe problem of the value of truth came before us—or was it \nwe who came before the problem? Who of us is Oedipus here? Who \n\n\nthe Sphinx? It is a rendezvous, it seems, of questions and question \nmarks, \nAnd though it scarcely seems credible, it finally almost seems \nto us as if the problem had never even been put so far—as if we \nwere the first to see it, fix it with our eyes, and risk it. For it does involve a risk, and perhaps there is none that is greater,",
    "Hollingdale": "The will to truth, which is still going to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise; \nthat celebrated veracity of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with \nreverence: what questions this will to truth has already set before us! What strange, \nwicked, questionable questions! It is already a long story — yet does it not seem as if\nit has only just begun? Is it any wonder we should at last grow distrustful, lose our \npatience, tum impatiently away? That this sphinx should teach us too to ask \nquestions? Who really is it that here questions us? What really is it in us that wants \n‘the truth’? — We did indeed pause for a long time before the question of the origin \nof this will — until finally we came to a complete halt before an even more \nfundamental question. We asked after the value of this will. Granted we want truth: \n\n\nwhy not rather untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? — The problem of the \nvalue of truth stepped before us — or was it we who stepped before this problem? \nWhich of us is Oedipus here? Which of us sphinx? It is, it seems, a rendezvous of \nquestions and question-marks. — And, would you believe it, it has finally almost \ncome to seem to us that this problem has never before been posed — that we have \nbeen the first to see it, to fix our eye on it, to hazard it? For there is a hazard in \nand perhaps there exists no greater hazard.",

    "Zimmern": "science of logical method. Not to assume several kinds of \ncausahty, so long as the attempt to get along with a single \none has not been pushed to its furtherest extent (to absurdity, if I may be allowed to say so) : that is a morality of \nmethod which one may not repudiate nowadays — it follows \n\"from its definition,\" as mathematicians say. The question \nis ultimately whether we really recognise the will as operating, whether we believe in the causahty of the will ; if we do \nso — and fundamentally our belief in this is just our belief in \ncausahty itself — we must make the attempt to posit hypothetically the causahty of the will as the only causahty. \n\"Will\" can naturally only operate on \"will\" — and not on \n\"matter\" (not on \"nerves,\" for instance) : in short, the \nhypothesis must be hazarded, whether will does not operate \non will wherever \"effects\" are recognised — and whether all \nmechanical action, inasmuch as a power operates therein, is \nnot just the power of will, the effect of will. Granted, \nfinally, that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and ramification of one fundamental form of will — namely, the Will to Power, as my \nthesis puts it; granted that all organic functions could be \ntraced back to this Will to Power, and that the solution \nof the problem of generation and nutrition — it is one problem— could also be found therein: one would thus have acquired the right to define all active force unequivocally as \nWiU to Power. The world seen from within, the world defined and designated according to its \"intelhgible character\" \n— it would simply be \"Will to Power,\" and nothing else. \n\n\n44 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL"
