    "Gutenberg": "Man vergebe es mir als einem alten Philologen, der von der Bosheit\nnicht lassen kann, auf schlechte Interpretations-Künste den Finger zu\nlegen - aber jene \"Gesetzmässigkeit der Natur\", von der ihr Physiker\nso stolz redet, wie als ob - - besteht nur Dank eurer Ausdeutung und\nschlechten \"Philologie\", - sie ist kein Thatbestand, kein \"Text\",\nvielmehr nur eine naiv-humanitäre Zurechtmachung und Sinnverdrehung,\nmit der ihr den demokratischen Instinkten der modemen Seele sattsam\nentgegenkommt! \"Überall Gleichheit vor dem Gesetz, - die Natur\nhat es darin nicht anders und nicht besser als wir\": ein artiger\nHintergedanke, in dem noch einmal die pöbelmännische Feindschaft gegen\nalles Bevorrechtete und Selbstherrhche, insgleichen ein zweiter und\nfeinerer Atheismus verkleidet hegt. \"Ni dieu, ni maître\" - so wollt\nauch ihr's.- und darum \"hoch das Naturgesetz\"! - nicht wahr? Aber,\nwie gesagt, das ist Interpretation, nicht Text; und es könnte\nJemand kommen, der, mit der entgegengesetzten Absicht und\nInterpretationskunst, aus der gleichen Natur und im Hinbhck auf\ndie gleichen Erscheinungen, gerade die tyrannisch-rücksichtenlose\nund unerbitthche Durchsetzung von Machtansprüchen herauszulesen\nverstünde, - ein Interpret, der die Ausnahmslosigkeit und\nUnbedingtheit in allem \"Willen zur Macht\" dermaassen euch vor\nAugen stellte, dass fast jedes Wort und selbst das Wort \"Tyrannei\"\nschhesshch unbrauchbar oder schon als schwächende und mildemde\nMetapher - als zu menschhch - erschiene; und der dennoch damit\nendete, das Gleiche von dieser Welt zu behaupten, was ihr behauptet,\nnämhch dass sie einen \"nothwendigen\" und \"berechenbaren\" Verlauf\nhabe, aber nicht, weil Gesetze in ihr herrschen, sondem weil absolut\ndie Gesetze fehlen, und jede Macht in jedem Augenbhcke ihre letzte\nConsequenz zieht. Gesetzt, dass auch dies nur Interpretation ist - und\nihr werdet eifrig genug sein, dies einzuwenden? - nun, um so besser. -",
    "Kaufmann": "Forgive me as an old philologist who cannot desist from the \nmahce of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation: but \n“nature’s conformity to law,\" of which you physicists talk so \nproudly, as though—why, it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad “philology.” It is no matter of fact, no “text,” but \nrather only a naively humanitarian emendation and perversion of \nmeaning, with which you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modem soul! “Everywhere equality before the \nlaw; nature is no different in that respect, no better off than we \n\n\nare”—a fine instance of ulterior motivation, in which the plebeian \nantagonism to everything privileged and autocratic as well as a second and more refined atheism are disguised once more. “Ni Dieu, nt \nmaitre” *°—that is what you, too, want; and therefore “cheers for \nthe law of nature!””—is it not so? But as said above, that is interpretation, not text; and somebody might come along who, with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation, could read out of the \nsame “nature,” and with regard to the same phenomena, rather \nthe tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of claims \nof power—an interpreter who would picture the unexceptional and \nunconditional aspects of all “will to power” so vividly that almost \nevery word, even the word “tyranny” itself, would eventually seem \nunsuitable, or a weakening and attenuating metaphor—being too \nhuman—but he might, nevertheless, end by asserting the same \nabout this world as you do, namely, that it has a “necessary” and \n“calculable” course, not because laws obtain in it, but because \nthey are absolutely lacking, and every power draws its ultimate \nconsequences at every moment, Supposing that this also is only in34 “The religion of human suffering.” \n25 “Neither God nor master.” \nON THB PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS 31 \nterpretation—and you will be eager enough to make this objec \ntion?——well, so much the better,",
    "Hollingdale": "You must pardon me as an old philologist who cannot refrain from the \nmahciousness of putting his finger on bad arts of interpretation: but ‘nature's \nconformity to law’ of which you physicists speak so proudly, as though — it exists \nonly thanks to your interpretation and bad ‘philology’ — it is not a fact, not a ‘text’\nbut rather only a naive humanitarian adjustment and distortion of meaning with \nwhich you go more than halfway to meet the democratic instincts of the modem \nsoul! ‘Everywhere equality before the law — nature is in this matter no different \nfrom us and no better off than we’: a nice piece of mental reservation in which \nvulgar hostihty towards everything privileged and autocratic, as well as a second and \nmore subtle atheism, he once more disguised. ‘Ni dieu, ni maitre’ — that is your \nmotto too: and therefore ‘long live the law of nature!’ — isn't that so?

    "Norman": "You must forgive an old philologist hke me who cannot help mahciously \nputting his finger on bad tricks of interpretation: but this “conformity of \nnature to law,” which you physicists are so proud of, just as if — — exists \nonly because of your interpretation and bad “philology.” It is not a matter \nof fact, not a “text,” but instead only a naive humanitarian correction and \na distortion of meaning that you use in order to comfortably accommodate \nthe democratic instincts of the modem soul! “Everywhere, equality before \nthe law, — in this respect, nature is no different and no better off than \nwe are”: a lovely case of ulterior motivation; and it serves once more \nto disguise the plebeian antagonism against all privilege and autocracy \ntogether with a second and more refined atheism. “Ni dieu, ni maitre”?* — \nyou want this too: and therefore “hurray for the laws of nature!” — right? \nBut, as I have said, this is interpretation, not text; and somebody with an \nopposite intention and mode of interpretation could come along and be \nable to read from the same nature, and with reference to the same set of \nappearances, a tyrannically ruthless and pitiless execution of power claims. \nThis sort of interpreter would show the unequivocal and unconditional \nnature of all “will to power” so vividly and graphically that almost every \nword, and even the word “tyranny,” would ultimately seem useless or \nhke weakening and molhfying metaphors — and too humanizing. Yet this \n?? The religion of human suffering. \n?! Neither God nor master.",
    "Faber": "If youll forgive me, an old philologist who can’t give up the \nwickedness of pointing out examples of bad interpretative practice, \nthe ‘lawfulness of nature’ that you physicists speak about so proudly, \nas if ...—this only exists by grace of your interpretations, your \nbad ‘philology’; it is not a factual matter, not a ‘text’, but rather no \nmore than a naive humanitarian concoction, a contortion of \nmeaning that allows you to succeed in accommodating the democratic instincts of the modem soul! ‘Equality before the law is \neverywhere—nature is no different and no better than we are’— \nthis amiable ulterior thought once again masks the plebcian’s enmity \ntowards everything privileged and autocratic, as well as a new and \nmore subtle atheism. ‘Ni dieu, ni maitre’*—that’s what you folks \nwant, too. So, ‘long live the law of nature!’ Isn’t that right? But as \nI say, this is interpretation, not text; and someone could come along \nwith the opposite intention and interpretative skill who, looking at \nthe very same nature and referring to the very same phenomena, \nwould read out of it the ruthlessly tyrannical and unrelenting \nassertion of power claims. Such an interpreter would put to you \nthe universahty and unconditionahty in all ‘will to power’ in such \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers 23 \na way that virtually every word, even the word ‘tryanny’, would \nultimately appear useless or at least only as a modifying, mitigating \nmetaphor—as too human. Yet this philosopher, too, would end by \nmaking the same claims for his world as you others do for yours, \nnamely that its course is ‘necessary’ and ‘predictable’, not because \nlaws are at work in it, but rather because the laws are absolutely \n\n\nlacking, and in every moment every power draws its final consequence. And given that he too is just interpreting—and you'll be \neager to raise that objection, won’t you?—then, all the better.",
    "Zimmern": "Let me be pardoned, as an old philologist who cannot \ndesist from the mischief of putting his finger on bad modes \nof interpretation, but \"Nature's conformity to law,\" of which \nyou physicists talk so proudly, as though — why, it exists only \nowing to your interpretation and bad \"philology.\" It is no \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 35 \nmatter of fact, no \"text,\" but rather just a naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning, with which \nyou make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts \nof the modem soul! \"Everywhere equality before the law — \nNature is not different in that respect, nor better than we:\" \na fine instance of secret motive, in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and autocratic — hkewise a \nsecond and more refined atheism — is once more disguised. \n\"Ni dieu, ni maitre\" — that, also, is what you want; and \ntherefore \"Cheers for natural law!\" — is it not so?
