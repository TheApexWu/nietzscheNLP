    "Gutenberg": "Was sich am schlechtesten aus einer Sprache in die andere übersetzen\nlässt, ist das tempo ihres Stils: als welcher im Charakter der Rasse\nseinen Grund hat, physiologischer gesprochen, im Durchschnitts-tempo\nihres \"Stoffwechsels\". Es giebt ehrhch gemeinte Übersetzungen, die\nbeinahe Fälschungen sind, als unfreiwilhge Vergemeinerungen des\nOriginals, bloss weil sein tapferes und lustiges tempo nicht mit\nübersetzt werden konnte, welches über alles Gefährhche in Dingen und\nWorten wegspringt, weghilft. Der Deutsche ist beinahe des Presto in\nseiner Sprache unfähig: also, wie man bilhg schhessen darf, auch\nvieler der ergötzhchsten und verwegensten Nuances des freien,\nfreigeisterischen Gedankens. So gut ihm der Buffo und der Satyr fremd\nist, in Leib und Gewissen, so gut ist ihm Aristophanes und Petronius\nunübersetzbar. Alles Gravitätische, Schwerflüssige, Feierhch-Plumpe,\nalle langwierigen und langweihgen Gattungen des Stils sind bei den\nDeutschen in überreicher Mannichfaltigkeit entwickelt, - man vergebe\nmir die Thatsache, dass selbst Goethe's Prosa, in ihrer Mischung von\nSteifheit und Zierhchkeit, keine Ausnahme macht, als ein Spiegelbild\nder \"alten guten Zeit\", zu der sie gehört, und als Ausdruck des\ndeutschen Geschmacks, zur Zeit, wo es noch einen \"deutschen Geschmack\"\ngab: der ein Rokoko-Geschmack war, in moribus et artibus. Lessing\nmacht eine Ausnahme, Dank seiner Schauspieler-Natur, die Vieles\nverstand und sich auf Vieles verstand: er, der nicht umsonst der\nÜbersetzer Bayle's war und sich geme in die Nähe Diderot's und\nVoltaire's, noch heber unter die römischen Lustspieldichter\n\nflüchtete: - Lessing hebte auch im tempo die Freigeisterei, die\nFlucht aus Deutschland. Aber wie vermöchte die deutsche Sprache, und\nsei es selbst in der Prosa eines Lessing, das tempo Macchiavell's\nnachzuahmen, der, in seinem principe, die trockne feine Luft von\nFlorenz athmen lässt und nicht umhin kann, die emsteste Angelegenheit\nin einem unbändigen Allegrissimo vorzutragen: vielleicht nicht ohne\nein boshaftes Artisten-Gefühl davon, welchen Gegensatz er wagt,Gedanken, lang, schwer, hart, gefährhch, und ein tempo des Galopps\nund der allerbesten muthwilhgsten Laune. Wer endhch dürfte gar eine\ndeutsche Übersetzung des Petronius wagen, der, mehr als irgend ein\ngrosser Musiker bisher, der Meister des presto gewesen ist, in\nErfindungen, Einfällen, Worten: - was hegt zuletzt an allen Sümpfen\nder kranken, schhmmen Welt, auch der \"alten Welt\", wenn man, wie er,\ndie Füsse eines Windes hat, den Zug und Athem, den befreienden Hohn\neines Windes, der Alles gesund macht, indem er Alles laufen macht! Und\nwas Aristophanes angeht, jenen verklärenden, complementären Geist, um\ndessentwillen man dem ganzen Griechenthum verzeiht, dass es da war,\ngesetzt, dass man in aller Tiefe begriffen hat, was da Alles der\nVerzeihung, der Verklärung bedarf: - so wüsste ich nichts, was mich\nüber Plato's Verborgenheit und Sphinx-Natur mehr hat träumen lassen\nals jenes glückhch erhaltene petit falt: dass man unter dem\nKopfkissen seines Sterbelagers keine \"Bibel\" vorfand, nichts\nÄgyptisches, Pythagoreisches, Platonisches, - sondem den\nAristophanes. Wie hätte auch ein Plato das Leben ausgehalten - ein\ngriechisches Leben, zu dem er Nein sagte, - ohne einen Aristophanes! -",

    "Hollingdale": "That which translates worst from one language into another is the tempo of its style, \nwhich has its origin in the character of the race, or, expressed more physiologically, \nin the average tempo of its ‘metabohsm’. There are honestly meant translations \nwhich, as involuntary vulgarizations of the original, are almost falsifications simply \nbecause it was not possible to translate also its brave and happy tempo, which leaps \nover and puts behind it all that is perilous in things and words. The German is \nvirtually incapable of presto in his language: thus, it may be fairly concluded, also o\nmany of the most daring and delightful nuances of free, free-spirited thought. Just \nas the buffo and the satyr is strange to him, in his body and in his conscience, so \nAristophanes and Petronius are untranslatable for him. Everything staid, sluggish, \nponderously solemn, all long-winded and boring species of style have been \ndeveloped in profuse multiphcity among the Germans — pardon me for the fact that \neven Goethe's prose is, in its blend of elegance and stiffness, no exception: it is a \nreflection of the ‘good old days’, to which it belongs, and an expression of the \nGerman taste of a time when there still was a ‘German taste’: it was rococo in \nmoribus et artibus. Lessing constitutes an exception, thanks to his histrionic nature, \nwhich was versed in and understood much: he, who was not for nothing the \ntranslator of Bayle and hked to flee to the neighbourhood of Diderot and Voltaire \nand even more to that of the Roman writers of comedy — in tempo too Lessing \nloved free-spiritedness, escape from Germany. But how could the German \nlanguage, even in the prose of a Lessing, imitate the tempo of Machiavelh, who in \nhis Principe lets us breathe the subtle dry air of Florence and cannot help presenting \nthe most serious affairs in a boisterous allegrissimo: not perhaps without a mahcious \nartist's sense of the contrast he is risking — thoughts protracted, difficult, hard, \n\n\ndangerous and the tempo of the gallop and the most wanton good humour.

    "Norman": "28 The hardest thing to translate from one language into another is the tempo of its style, which is grounded in the character of the race, or — to be more physiological — in the average tempo of its metabolism.\" There are well-meaning interpretations that are practically falsifications; they involuntarily debase the original, simply because it has atempo that cannot be translated — a tempo that is brave and cheerful and leaps over and out of every danger in things and in words. Germans are almost incapable of a presto in their language: and so it is easy to see that they are incapable of many of the most delightful and daring nuances of free, free-spirited thought. Since the buffo and the satyr are alien to the German in body and in conscience, Aristophanes and Petronius are as good as untranslatable. Everything ponderous, lumbering, solemnly awkward, every long-winded and boring type of style is developed by the Germans in over-abundant diversity. Forgive me for pointing out that even Goethe's prose, with its mixture of the stiff and the delicate, is no exception; it is both a reflection of the “good old days\" to which it belonged and an expression of the German taste back when there still was a German taste\": it was a Rococo taste, in moribus et artibus. Lessing is an exception, thanks to his actor’s nature that understood and excelled at so much. He was not the translator of Bayle for nothing; he gladly took refuge in the company of Diderot and Voltaire, and still more gladly among the Roman writers of comedy. Even in tempo, Lessing loved free-thinking? and the escape from Germany. But how could the German language — even in the prose of a Lessing — imitate Machiavelli’s tempo — Machiavelli who, in his Principe, lets us breathe the fine, dry air of Florence? He cannot help presenting the most serious concerns in a boisterous a//egrissimo, and is, perhaps, not without ® Tn customs and arts. 7 In German: Freigeisterei. 8 II Principe (The Prince) (1532).",
    "Faber": "The hardest thing to translate from one language to another is the \ntempo of its style; this style has its basis in the character of the race, \nor to speak more physiologically, in the average tempo of the race’s \n‘metabohsm’. There are some well-intended translations that are \nalmost counterfeits, involuntary crudifications of the original, \nsimply because they could not capture its bright, brave tempo, one \nthat leaps over, transports over all the dangers in words and things. \nThe German is nearly incapable of the presto in his language, and \nwe may feel free to conclude that he is therefore also incapable of \nmany of the most amusing and audacious nuances of free, freespirited thought. Just as the buffo* and the satyr are ahen to him, \n\n\nbody and soul, so are Aristophanes and Petronius* untranslatable \nby him. The Germans have developed an excessive variety of \neverything solemn, sluggish, ceremoniously clumsy, all the interminable and insufferable styhstic genres—and may I be forgiven for \npointing out that even Goethe’s prose, with its mixture of stiffness \nand daintiness, is no exception, reflecting the ‘good old days’ to \nwhich it belongs and expressing German taste in an age when there \nwas still such a thing as ‘German taste’: it was a Rococo taste, in \nmoribus et artibus.* Lessing* is the exception: thanks to his actor’s \nnature he understood much and was skilled in much; it was not \nfor nothing that he translated Bayle* and hked to escape to the \ncompany of Diderot and Voltaire and still more to the Roman \nwriters of comedy: even in his tempo, Lessing loved freethinking \nand the escape from Germany. But how could the German language, \neven in the prose of a Lessing, imitate the tempo of Machiavelh,* \nwho lets us breathe the fine, dry air of Florence in his Prince and \ncannot keep from presenting the most serious business in a wild \nallegrissimo, perhaps not without an artist’s mahcious feehng for \nthe contradiction he is attempting: the thoughts long, heavy, harsh, \ndangerous, set to a galloping tempo of the finest, most mischievous \nmood. And who could ever dare a German translation of Petronius, \nwhose conceits, ideas, words master the presto better than any \nmusician before him: what do all the swamps of this sick, wicked \n30 Beyond Good and Evil \nworld, or of the ‘old world’ matter, if you have the feet of the wind \nas he does, its breath and draught, the hberating mockery of a \nwind that makes everything healthy by making everything rum! And \nas for Aristophanes, that transfiguring, complementary spirit, for \nwhose sake one forgives all of ancient Greece for existing, assuming \nthat one has grasped in all its profundity what it is that requires \nforgiving, requires transfiguring: I know of nothing that set me to \nmusing about P/ato’s opaqueness and sphinx-hke nature as much \nas that fortunately preserved petit fait:* that under the pillow of his \ndeath bed, no ‘bible’, nothing Egyptian or Pythagorean or Platonic \nwas discovered—but rather Aristophanes.
