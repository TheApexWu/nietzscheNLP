    "Gutenberg": "Es ist schwer, verstanden zu werden: besonders wenn man gangasrotogati\ndenkt und lebt, unter lauter Menschen, welche anders denken und leben,\nnämhch kurmagati oder besten Falles \"nach der Gangart des Frosches\"\nmandeikagati - ich thue eben Alles, um selbst schwer verstanden zu\nwerden? - und man soll schon für den guten Willen zu einiger Feinheit\nder Interpretation von Herzen erkennthch sein. Was aber \"die guten\nFreunde\" anbetrifft, welche immer zu bequem sind und gerade als\nFreunde ein Recht auf Bequemhchkeit zu haben glauben: so thut\nman gut, ihnen von vomherein einen Spielraum und Tummelplatz des\nMissverständnisses zuzugestehn: - so hat man noch, zu lachen; - oder\nsie ganz abzuschaffen, diese guten Freunde, - und auch zu lachen!",
    "Kaufmann": "It is hard to be understood, especially when one thinks and \nlives gangdsrotagati’ among men who think and live differently— \nnamely, kiirmagati,® or at best “the way frogs walk,” mandükagati? (I obviously do everything to be “hard to understand” myself!)—and one should be cordially grateful for the good will to \nsome subtlety of interpretation. As regards “the good friends,” \nhowever, who are always too lazy and think that as friends they \n\n\n7 In the original edition: gangasrotogati. Although the second “o” is clearly \na misprint, it has not been corrected in later editions or in the English trans \nlations. Gat? means gait; srota, the current of a river, and ganga is the river \nGanges. So the word means: as the current of the Ganges moves. (For the \ninformation about the Sanskrit words, also in the two following notes, I \nam indebted to Professor Samuel D, Atkins.) \n8 As the tortoise moves. In the original edition and in subsequent editions \nand translations the diacritical mark is missing. \n8 In the original edition: mandeikagati, without diacritical marks. The “ei” \nis a misprint, perhaps due to the misreading of a handwritten “u”-~but has \nbeen perpetuated in subsequent editions and translations, \nFar from being merely playful or concemed with style to the exclusion \nof philosophy, this section touches on a crucial problem: Nietzsche's tempo \nis a major reason for the long delay in his reception as a philosopher; and \nthree quarters of a century after the appearance of Beyond Good and Evil \nthe tempo of articles in British and American philosophical joumals had \nslowed down to the point where many philosophers were bound to feel that \nanything written gängäsrotagati simply could not be philosophy. Even Wittgenstein, though he had never followed the fashion of moving hke the tortoise, had at least proceeded mandükagati. For this whole question of philosophical style and tempo see Kaufmann, Critique of Religion and Philosophy (Garden City, N.Y., Anchor Books), sections 3-10, \n40 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nhave a right to relax, one does well to grant them from the outset \nsome leeway and romping place for misunderstanding: then one \ncan even laugh—or get rid of them altogether, these good friends \n—and also laugh.",
    "Hollingdale": "It is hard to be understood: especially when one thinks and lives gangasrotogati \namong men who think and live otherwise, namely kurmagati or at best ‘as the frog \ngoes’, mandeikagati — I am certainly doing everything I can to be hard to understand \nmyself! — and one ought to be heartily grateful even for the will to some subtlety in \ninterpretation. As regards one's ‘good friends’, however, who are always too indolent \nand think that because they are one's friends they have a right to indolence: one \ndoes well to allow them from the first some room and latitude for misunderstanding \n— thus one can laugh at their expense; — or get rid of them altogether, these good \nfriends — and still laugh!",
    "Norman": "an urge to talk about themselves and their peers in front of witnesses: — \nsometimes they even wallow in books as if in their own filth. Cynicism is \nthe only form in which base souls touch upon that thing which is genuine \nhonesty. And the higher man needs to open his ears to all cynicism, crude \nor refined, and congratulate himself every time the buffoon speaks up \nwithout shame, or the scientific satyr is heard right in front of him. There \nare even cases where enchantment mixes with disgust: namely, where \ngenius, by a whim of nature, is tied to some indiscreet billy-goat and \nape, hke the Abbé Gahani, the most profound, disceming, and perhaps \nalso the filthiest man of his century. He was much more profound than \n\n\nVoltaire, and consequently a lot quieter. But, as I have already suggested, \nwhat happens more often is that the scientific head is placed on an ape's \nbody, a more subtle and exceptional understanding is put in a base soul. \nThis is not a rare phenomenon, particularly among physicians and physiologists of morals. And wherever even one person is speaking about man \nwithout any bittemess but instead quite innocuously, describing him as a \nstomach with dual needs and a head with one; wherever someone sees and \nseeks and wants to see only hunger, sex-drive and vanity, as if these were \nthesole and genuine motivating forces of human action; in short, wherever \nsomebody is speaking “badly” of people — and not even mickedly — this is \nwhere the lover of knowledge should hsten with subtle and studious attention. He should keep his ears open wherever people are speaking without \nanger. Because the angry man, and anyone who is constantly tearing and \nshredding himself with his own teeth (or, in place of himself, the world, or \nGod, or society), may very well stand higher than the laughing and selfsatisfied satyr, considered morally. But considered in any other way, he \nis the more ordinary, more indifferent, less instructive case. And nobody \nhes as much as the angry man. —",
    "Faber": "Making yourself understood is hard—especially if you live and \nthink gangasrotogati,* amidst people who all think and live differently, namely kurmagati, or in the best case, ‘in the manner of \nfrogs’, mandeikagati (am I doing all I can to make myself hard to \nunderstand, too?), and we should be sincerely grateful to anyone \nwho cares enough to achieve some subtlety as an interpreter. But \nas for ‘good friends’, who are always too comfortable and think \nthat as friends they are entitled to be so: it is wise to start by \ngranting them elbow room and a playground for misunderstanding—then there is still an occasion for laughing—or else just \nThe Free Spirit 29 \ndo away with them entirely, these good friends—and laugh about \nthat, too!",
    "Zimmern": "It is difficult to be understood, especially when one thinks \nand lives gangasrotogati* among those only who think and \nlive otherwise — namely, kurmagati,^ or at best \"froghke,\" \nmandeikagati% (I do everything to be \"difficultly understood\" \nmyself!) — and one should be heartily grateful for the good \nwill to some refinement of interpretation. As regards \"the \ngood friends,\" however, who are always too easy-going, and \nthink that as friends they have a right to ease, one does \nwell at the very first to grant them a play-ground and romping-place for misunderstanding — one c£m thus laugh still; or \nget rid of them altogether, these good friends — and laugh \nthen also!"
