    "Gutenberg": "Die Physiologen sollten sich besinnen, den Selbsterhaltungstrieb als\nkardinalen Trieb eines organischen Wesens anzusetzen. Vor Allem will\netwas Lebendiges seine Kraft auslassen - Leben selbst ist Wille\nzur Macht -: die Selbsterhaltung ist nur eine der indirekten\nund häufigsten Folgen davon. - Kurz, hier wie überall, Vorsicht\nvor überflüssigen teleologischen Principien! - wie ein solches\nder Selbsterhaltungstrieb ist (man dankt ihn der Inconsequenz\nSpinoza's -). So nämhch gebietet es die Methode, die wesenthch\nPrincipien-Sparsamkeit sein muss.",
    "Kaufmann": "Physiologists should think before putting down the instinct \nof self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being. A \nhving thing seeks above all to discharge its strength—life itself is \nwill to power; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and \nmost frequent results. \nIn short, here as everywhere else, let us beware of superfluous \nteleological principles—one of which is the instinct of selfpreservation (we owe it to Spinoza’s inconsisteney).!® Thus \nmethod, which must be essentially economy of principles, demands \nit,",
    "Hollingdale": "Physiologists should think again before postulating the drive to self-preservation as \nthe cardinal drive in an organic being. A hving thing desires above all to vent its \nstrength — life as such is will to power — : self-preservation is only one of the \nindirect and most frequent consequences of it. — In short, here as everywhere, \nbeware of superfluous teleological principles! — such as is the drive to selfpreservation (we owe it to Spinoza's inconsistency). For this is a requirement of \nmethod, which has essentially to be economy of principles.",
    "Norman": "is, I hope, understood? — has had all over Europe, a certain virtus dormitiva \nhas undoubtedly had a role: the noble idlers, the virtuous, the mystics, \nartists, three-quarter-Christians, and pohtical obscurantists of all nations \nwere all delighted to have, thanks to German philosophy, an antidote to \nthe still overpowering sensuahsm that was spilhng over into this century \nfrom the previous one, in short — “sensus assoupire” ... \nI2 \nAs far as materiahstic atomism goes: this is one of the most well-refuted \nthings in existence. In Europe these days, nobody in the scholarly community 1s hkely to be so unscholarly as to attach any real significance to \n\n\nit, except as a handy household tool (that is, as an abbreviated figure of \nspeech). For this, we can thank that Pole, Boscovich, who, together with \nthe Pole, Copemicus, was the greatest, most successful opponent of the \nvisual evidence. While Copemicus convinced us to believe, contrary to \nall our senses, that the earth does not stand still, Boscovich taught us to \nrenounce belief in the last bit of earth that did “stand still,” the belief in \n“matter,” in the “material,” in the residual piece of earth and clump of an \natom: it was the greatest triumph over the senses that the world had ever \nknown. — But we must go further still and declare war — a ruthless fight \nto the finish — on the “atomistic need” that, hke the more famous “metaphysical need,\" still leads a dangerous afterlife in regions where nobody \nwould think to look. First of all, we must also put an end to that other \nand more disastrous atomism, the one Christianity has taught best and \nlongest, the atomism of the soul. Let this expression signify the belief that \nthe soul is something indestructible, etemal, indivisible, that it isa monad, \nan atomon: this belief must be thrown out of science! Between you and \nme, there is absolutely no need to give up “the soul” itself, and rehnquish \none of the oldest and most venerable hypotheses — as often happens with \nnaturahsts: given their clumsiness, they barely need to touch “the soul” \nto lose it. But the path hes open for new versions and sophistications of \nthe soul hypothesis — and concepts hke the “mortal soul” and the “soul as \nsubject-multiphcity” and the “soul as a society constructed out of drives \nand affects” want henceforth to have civil rights in the realm of science. \nBy putting an end to the superstition that until now has grown around the \nidea of the soul with an almost tropical luxuriance, the new psychologist \nclearly thrusts himself into a new wasteland and a new suspicion.

    "Faber": "Physiologists should think twice before deciding that an organic \nbeing’s primary instinct is the instinct for self-preservation. A hving \nbeing wants above all else to release its strength; life itself is the \nwill to power, and self-preservation is only one of its indirect and \nmost frequent consequences. \nHere as everywhere, in short, we must beware of superfluous teleological principles! And this is what the instinct for self-preservation \nis (which we owe to the inconsistency of Spinoza).* Such are \nthe dictates of our method, which in essence demands that we be \nfrugal with our principles.",
    "Zimmern": "Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting \ndown the instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct \nof an organic being. A hving thing seeks above all to discharge its strength — ^life itself is Will to Power; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent results> \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL i^ \nthereof. In short, here, as everywhere else, let us beware of \nsuperfluous teleological principles! — one of which is the instinct of self-preservation (we owe it to Spinoza's inconsistency) . It is thus, in effect, that method ordains, which must \nbe essentially economy of principles."
