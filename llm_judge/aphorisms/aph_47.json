    "Gutenberg": "Wo nur auf Erden bisher die rehgiöse Neurose aufgetreten ist, finden\nwir sie verknüpft mit drei gefährhchen Diät-Verordnungen: Einsamkeit,\nFasten und geschlechthcher Enthaltsamkeit, - doch ohne dass hier mit\nSicherheit zu entscheiden wäre, was da Ursache, was Wirkung sei, und\nob hier überhaupt ein Verhältniss von Ursache und Wirkung vorhege.\nZum letzten Zweifel berechtigt, dass gerade zu ihren regelmässigsten\nSymptomen, bei wilden wie bei zahmen Völkem, auch die plötzhchste\nausschweifendste Wollüstigkeit gehört, welche dann, ebenso plötzhch,\nin Busskrampf und Welt- und Willens-Vemeinung umschlägt: beides\nvielleicht als maskirte Epilepsie deutbar? Aber nirgendswo sollte man\nsich der Deutungen mehr entschlagen: um keinen Typus herum ist bisher\neine solche Fülle von Unsinn und Aberglauben aufgewachsen, keiner\nscheint bisher die Menschen, selbst die Philosophen, mehr interessirt\nzu haben, - es wäre an der Zeit, hier gerade ein Wenig kalt zu werden,\nVorsicht zu lemen, besser noch: wegzusehn, wegzugehn. - Noch im\nHintergrunde der letztgekommenen Philosophie, der Schopenhauerischen,\nsteht, beinahe als das Problem an sich, dieses schauerhche\nFragezeichen der rehgiösen Krisis und Erweckung. Wie ist\nWillensvemeinung möghch? wie ist der Heihge möghch? - das\nscheint wirkhch die Frage gewesen zu sein, bei der Schopenhauer\nzum Philosophen wurde und anfieng. Und so war es eine ächt\nSchopenhauerische Consequenz, dass sein überzeugtester Anhänger\n(vielleicht auch sein letzter, was Deutschland betrifft -), nämhch\nRichard Wagner, das eigne Lebenswerk gerade hier zu Ende brachte und\nzuletzt noch jenen furchtbaren und ewigen Typus als Kundry auf der\nBühne vorführte, type vécu, und wie er leibt und lebt; zu gleicher\nZeit, wo die Irrenärzte fast aller Länder Europa's einen Anlass\nhatten, ihn aus der Nähe zu studiren, überall, wo die rehgiöse\nNeurose - oder, wie ich es nenne, \"das rehgiöse Wesen\" - als\n\"Heilsarmee\" ihren letzten epidemischen Ausbruch und Aufzug gemacht\nhat. - Fragt man sich aber, was eigenthch am ganzen Phänomen des\nHeihgen den Menschen aller Art und Zeit, auch den Philosophen, so\nunbändig interessant gewesen ist: so ist es ohne allen Zweifel der\nihm, anhaftende Anschein des Wunders, nämhch der unmittelbaren\nAufeinanderfolge von Gegensätzen, von morahsch entgegengesetzt\ngewertheten Zuständen der Seele: man glaubte hier mit Händen zu\ngreifen, dass aus einem \"schlechten Menschen\" mit Einem Male ein\n\"Heihger\", ein guter Mensch werde. Die bisherige Psychologie htt an\ndieser Stelle Schiffbruch: sollte es nicht vornehmhch darum geschehen\nsein, weil sie sich unter die Herrschaft der Moral gestellt hatte,\nweil sie an die morahschen Werth-Gegensätze selbst glaubte, und diese\nGegensätze in den Text und Thatbestand hineinsah, hineinlas, hinein\n\ndeutete? - Wie? Das \"Wunder\" nur ein Fehler der Interpretation? Ein\nMangel an Philologie? -",
    "Kaufmann": "Wherever on earth the religious neurosis has appeared we find \nit tied to three dangerous dietary demands: sohtude, fasting, and \nsexual abstinence. But one cannot decide with certainty what is \ncause and what effect, and whether any relation of cause and effect \nis involved here, The final doubt seems justified because among its \nmost regular symptoms, among both savage and tame peoples, we \nalso find the most sudden, most extravagant voluptuousness which \nthen, just as suddenly, changes into a penitential spasm and denial \nof the world and will—both perhaps to be interpreted as masked \nepilepsy? But nowhere should one resist interpretation more: no \nother type has yet been surrounded by such a lavish growth of nonsense and superstition, no other type seems to have interested men, \neven philosophers, more. The time has come for becoming a bit \ncold right here, to leam caution—better yet: to look away, fo go \naway, \nEven in the background of the most recent philosophy, that of \nSchopenhauer, we find, almost as the problem-in-itself, this gruesome question mark of the religious crisis and awakening. How is \nthe denia of the will possible? how is the saint possible? This really \nseems to have been the question over which Schopenhauer became a \n\n\n62 BEYOND GOOD AND BYIL \nphilosopher and began. And so it was a genuinely Schopenhauerian \nconclusion when his most convinced adherent (perhaps also the \nlast one, as far as Germany is concemed), namely, Richard Wagner, finished his life’s work at precisely this point and in the end \nbrought this horrible and etemal type on the stage as Kundry, type \nvécu,’ in the flesh—at the very time when the psychiatrists of almost all the countries of Europe had occasion to study it at close \nquarters, wherever the religious neurosis—or what I call “das rehgiöse Wesen” *—~had its latest epidemic outbreak and pageant \nin the “Salvation Army.” \nLet us ask what precisely about this whole phenomenon of the \nsaint has seemed so enormously interesting to men of all types \nand ages, even to philosophers, Beyond any doubt, it was the air of \nthe miraculous that goes with it—namely, the immediate succession of opposites, of states of the soul that are judged morally in \nopposite ways. It seemed palpable that a “bad man” was suddenly \ntransformed into a “saint,” a good man. The psychology we have \nhad so far suffered shipwreck at this point: wasn’t this chiefly because it had placed itself under the dominion of morals, because it, \ntoo, believed in opposite moral values and saw, read, interpreted \nthese opposites into the text and the facts? \nWhat? The “miracle” merely a mistake of interpretation? A \nlack of philology?",
    "Hollingdale": "Wherever the religious neurosis has hitherto appeared on earth we find it tied to \nthree dangerous dietary prescriptions: sohtude, fasting and sexual abstinence — but \nwithout our being able to decide with certainty which is cause here and which \neffect, or whether any relation of cause and effect is involved here at all. The \njustification of the latter doubt is that one of the most frequent symptoms of the \ncondition, in the case of savage and tame peoples, is the most sudden and most \nextravagant voluptuousness which is then, just as suddenly, reversed into a \nconvulsion of penitence and a denial of world and will: both perhaps interpretable \nas masked epilepsy? But nowhere is it more necessary to renounce interpretations: \naround no other type has there grown up such an abundance of nonsense and \nsuperstition, none seems to have hitherto interested men, even philosophers, more — \nthe time has come to cool down a httle on this matter, to leam caution: better, to \nlook away, to go away. — Still in the background of the most recent philosophy, the \nSchopenhaueran, there stands, almost as the problem in itself, this gruesome \nquestion-mark of the religious crisis and awakening. How is denial of the will \npossible? How is the saint possible? — this really seems to have been the question \nover which Schopenhauer became a philosopher and set to work. And thus it \nshowed a genuinely Schopenhaueran outcome that his most convinced adherent \n(perhaps also his last adherent, so far as Germany is concemed —), namely Richard \nWagner, brought his own life's work to an end at precisely this point and at last \nintroduced that dreadful and etemal type onto the stage as Kundry, type vécu, just \nas it is; and at the very time when the psychiatrists of almost all the nations of \nEurope had an opportunity of studying it at close quarters wherever the religious \nneurosis — or, as I call it, ‘the religious nature’ — staged its latest epidemic parade\nand outbreak as the ‘Salvation Army’. — But if one asks what it has really been in \n\n\nthis whole phenomenon of the saint that has interested men of all types and ages, \neven philosophers, so immoderately, then the answer is, beyond doubt, the \nappearance of the miraculous adhering to it, namely the direct succession of \nopposites, of morally antithetical states of soul: here it seemed a palpable fact that \n‘bad man’ all at once became a ‘saint’, a good man. Pschology has hitherto come to \ngrief at this point: has it not been principally because it has acknowledged the \ndominion of morality, because it itself believed in antithetical moral values and saw, \nread, interpreted these antitheses into the text and the facts? — What? The ‘miracle’ \nonly an error of interpretation? A lack of philology? —",
    "Norman": "Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared so far, we find it connected \nwith three dangerous dietary prescriptions: sohtude, fasting, and sexual \nabstinence, — but without being able to say for sure which is the cause and \nwhich is the effect and whether in fact there is a causal relation at all. This \nlast doubt seems justified by the fact that another one of the most regular \nsymptoms of the religious neurosis, in both wild and tame peoples, is the \nmost sudden and dissipated display of voluptuousness, which then tums \njust as suddenly into spasms of repentance and negations of the world \nand will: perhaps both can be interpreted as epilepsy in disguise? But \nhere is where interpretation must be resisted the most: no type to date \nhas been surrounded by such an overgrowth of inanity and superstition; \nand none so far has seemed to hold more interest for people, or even for \nphilosophers. It might be time to calm down a bit, as far as this topic goes, \nto leam some caution, or even better: to look away, to go away. — This \ngruesome question-mark of religious crisis and awakening still stands \nin the background of the newest arrival in philosophy (which is to say: \nthe Schopenhauerian philosophy), almost as the problem in itself. How is \nnegation ofthe will possible? How is the saint possible? This really seems to \nhave been the question that started Schopenhauer off and made him into \na philosopher. And so it was a true Schopenhauerian consequence that his \nmost devoted follower (and perhaps also his last, as far as Germany was \nconcemed —), namely Richard Wagner, finished his own life's work at this \nvery point, and finally brought to the stage the life and times of that awful \nand etemal type in the character of Kundry, type vécu.+ And, at the same \ntime, psychiatrists in almost every European country had the opportunity \nto study this type up close, wherever the religious neurosis — or, as I call \nit, “the religious character” — was having its latest epidemic outbreak and \n+ A type that has lived. Kundry is a character from Wagner's last opera, Parsifal.",
    "Faber": "Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on earth until now, \nwe find it combined with three dangerous dietetic prescriptions: \nsohtude, fasting, and sexual abstinence—though it is impossible to \ndecide with certainty which is the cause, which the effect, and \nwhether in fact there is a cause-and-effect relationship at all. This \nlast doubt is justified if we consider that one of the most regular \nsymptoms of religious neurosis in both savage and civihzed peoples \nis a sudden, extravagant voluptuousness, which just as suddenly \ntums into spasms of penitence and a denial of the world and the \nwill; both perhaps to be interpreted as a disguised form of epilepsy? \nIn no area, however, should one be so ready to dismiss interpretations as here: no other archetype has given rise to such a wealth \nof nonsense and superstition, or held greater interest for people, \neven philosophers—this might be the right time to cool down, to \nleam caution, or even better: to look away, to go away. \nEven behind the most recent philosophy—Schopenhauer’s— \nthere still hes what is virtually the key problem, this terrifying \nquestion mark of religious crisis and religious awakening. How is \nthe denial of the will possible? How is sainthood possible? That really \ndoes seem to be the question that first concemed Schopenhauer \nand made him into a philosopher. And so it was a genuinely \nSchopenhauerian consequence that his most convinced disciple \n(perhaps his last one, too, in Germany at least), Richard Wagner \nby name, should have brought his own life’s work to a conclusion \nat just this point, introducing that terrible and etemal archetype to \nthe stage as Kundry,* type vécu,* in the hving flesh; at the same \ntime psychiatrists from nearly all the countries in Europe had \nopportunity to study the type at close quarters, wherever the most \nrecent epidemic of the religious neurosis—or, as I call it, the \nreligious disposition—broke out and marched forth in the guise of \nthe ‘Salvation Army’. \nIf we wonder what it is that all kinds of people at all times, even \n46 Beyond Good and Evil \n\n\nphilosophers, have continued to find so interesting in the whole \nphenomenon of the saint, the answer is surely its seeming miraculousness, the immediate succession of opposites, of conditions of the \nsoul with opposite moral value: here it seemed palpable that a ‘bad \nperson’ could all at once tum into a ‘saint’, a good person. This is \nwhere earher psychology ran aground: was it not chiefly because it \nhad submitted to the rule of morality, itself beheving in moral value \noppositions and seeing, reading, interpreting these oppositions into \nthe text and facts of the case?— \nWhat’s that? A ‘miracle’ may be only an interpretative error? A \nphilological failure?",
    "Zimmern": "Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth \nso far, we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen: sohtude, fasting, and sexual abstinence \n— but without its being possible to determine with certainty \nwhich is cause and which is effect, or if any relation at all of \ncause and effect exists there. This latter doubt is justified \nby the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among \nsavage as well as among civihsed peoples is the most sudden \nand excessive sensuality; which then with equal suddenness \ntransforms into penitential paroxysms, world-renunciation, \nand will-renunciation: both symptoms perhaps explainable \nas disguised epilepsy? But nowhere is it more obhgatory \nto put aside explanations: around no other type has there \ngrown such a mass of absurdity and superstition, no other \ntype seems to have been more interesting to men and even to \nphilosophers — perhaps it is time to become just a httle indifferent here, to leam caution, or, better still, to look away,. \nto go away. — Yet in the background of the most recent \nphilosophy, that of Schopenhauer, we find almost as the \n■roblem in itself, this terrible note of interrogation of the \ntehgious crisis and awakening. How is the negation of will \n^ssible? how is the saint possible? — that seems to have been \n■le very question with which Schopenhauer made a start \nand became a philosopher. And thus it was a genuine \nichopenhauerian consequence, that his most convinced adent (perhaps also his last, as far as Germany is coned), namely, Richard Wagner, should bring his ovm \nwork to an end just here, and should finally put that \nible and etemal type upon the stage as Kundry, type \nu, and as it loved and lived, at the very time that the \n\n\n56 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nmad-doctors in almost all European countries had an opportunity to study the type close at hand, wherever the religious neurosis — or as I call it, \"the religious mood\" — made \nits latest epidemical outbreak and display as the \"Salvation \nArmy.\" — If it be a question, however, as to what has been \nso extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages, and \neven to philosophers, in the whole phenomenon of the saint, \nit is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein \n— ^namely, the immediate succession of opposites, of states \nof the soul regarded as morally antithetical: it was believed \nhere to be self-evident that a \"bad man\" was all at once \ntumed into a \"saint,\" a good man. The hitherto existing \npsychology was wrecked at this point; is it not possible it \nmay have happened principally because psychology had \nplaced itself under the dominion of morals, because it believed in oppositions of moral values, and saw, read, and \ninterpreted these oppositions into the text and facts of the \ncase? What? \"Miracle\" only an error of interpretation? \nA lack of philology?"
