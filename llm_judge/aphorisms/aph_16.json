    "Gutenberg": "Es giebt immer noch harmlose Selbst-Beobachter, welche glauben, dass\nes \"unmittelbare Gewissheiten\" gebe, zum Beispiel \"ich denke\", oder,\nwie es der Aberglaube Schopenhauer's war, \"ich will\": gleichsam als ob\nhier das Erkennen rein und nackt seinen Gegenstand zu fassen bekäme,\nals \"Ding an sich\", und weder von Seiten des Subjekts, noch von\nSeiten des Objekts eine Fälschung stattfände. Dass aber \"unmittelbare\nGewissheit\", ebenso wie \"absolute Erkenntniss\" und \"Ding an sich\",\neine contradictio in adjecto in sich schhesst, werde ich hundertmal\nwiederholen: man sollte sich doch endhch von der Verführung der Worte\nlosmachen! Mag das Volk glauben, dass Erkennen ein zu Ende-Kennen sei,\nder Philosoph muss sich sagen: \"wenn ich den Vorgang zerlege, der in\ndem Satz `ich denke` ausgedrückt ist, so bekomme ich eine Reihe von\nverwegenen Behauptungen, deren Begründung schwer, vielleicht unmöghch\nist, - zum Beispiel, dass ich es bin, der denkt, dass überhaupt ein\nEtwas es sein muss, das denkt, dass Denken eine Thätigkeit und Wirkung\nseitens eines Wesens ist, welches als Ursache gedacht wird, dass es\nein `Ich` giebt, endhch, dass es bereits fest steht, was mit Denken\nzu bezeichnen ist, - dass ich weiss, was Denken ist. Denn wenn ich\nnicht darüber mich schon bei mir entschieden hätte, wonach sollte ich\nabmessen, dass, was eben geschieht, nicht vielleicht `Wollen` oder\n`Fühlen` sei? Genug, jenes `ich denke` setzt voraus, dass ich meinen\naugenbhckhchen Zustand mit anderen Zuständen, die ich an mir kenne,\nvergleiche, um so festzusetzen, was er ist: wegen dieser Rückbeziehung\nauf anderweitiges `Wissen` hat er für mich jedenfalls keine\nunmittelbare `Gewissheit`.\" - An Stelle jener \"unmittelbaren\nGewissheit\", an welche das Volk im gegebenen Falle glauben mag,\nbekommt dergestalt der Philosoph eine Reihe von Fragen der Metaphysik\nin die Hand, recht eigenthche Gewissensfragen des Intellekts, welche\nheissen: \"Woher nehme ich den Begriff Denken? Warum glaube ich an\nUrsache und Wirkung? Was giebt mir das Recht, von einem Ich, und\ngar von einem Ich als Ursache, und endhch noch von einem Ich als\nGedanken-Ursache zu reden?\" Wer sich mit der Berufung auf eine Art\nIntuition der Erkenntniss getraut, jene metaphysischen Fragen sofort\nzu beantworten, wie es Der thut, welcher sagt: \"ich, denke, und weiss,\ndass dies wenigstens wahr, wirkhch, gewiss ist\" - der wird bei einem\nPhilosophen heute ein Lächeln und zwei Fragezeichen bereit finden.\n\"Mein Herr, wird der Philosoph vielleicht ihm zu verstehen geben,\nes ist unwahrscheinhch, dass Sie sich nicht irren: aber warum auch\ndurchaus Wahrheit?\" -",
    "Kaufmann": "There are still harmless seff-observers who believe that there \nare “immediate certainties”; for example, “I think,” or as the superstition of Schopenhauer put it, “I will”; as though knowledge \nhere got hold of its object purely and nakedly as “the thing in itself,” without any falsification on the part of either the subject or \nthe object. But that “immediate certainty,” as well as “absolute \nknowledge” and the “thing in itself,” involve a contradictio in adjecto,** I shall repeat a hundred times; we really ought to free ourselves from the seduction of words! \nLet the people suppose that knowledge means knowing things \nentirely; the philosopher must say to himself; When I analyze the \nprocess that is expressed in the sentence, “I think,” I find a whole \nseries of daring assertions that would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to prove; for example, that it is J who think, that there must \nnecessarily be something that thinks, that thinking is an activity \nand operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause, \nthat there is an “ego,” and, finally, that it is already determined \nwhat is to be designated by thinking —that I know what thinking i is. \nFor if I had not already decided within myself what it is, by what \nstandard could I determine whether that which is just happening is \nnot perhaps “wilhng” or “feehng”? In short, the assertion “I think” \nassumes that I compare my state at the present moment with other \nstates of myself which I know, in order to determine what it is; on \naccount of this retrospective connection with further “knowledge,” \nit has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for me. \nIn Place of the “immediate certainty” in which the people may \nbelieve in the case at hand, the philosopher thus finds a series of \n29 Reduction to the absurd, \n\n\n20 Something that is its own cause—a.term traditionally apphed to God, \n2! Contradiction between the noun and the adjective. \n24 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nmetaphysical questions presented to him, truly searching questions \nof the intellect; to wit: “From where do I get the concept of thinking? Why do I believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right \nto speak of an ego, and even of an ego as cause, and finally of an \nego as the cause of thought?” Whoever ventures to answer these \nmetaphysical questions at once by an appeal to a sort of intuitive \nperception, hke the person who says, “I think, and know that this, \nat least, is true, actual, and certain”—will encounter a smile and \ntwo question marks from a philosopher nowadays. “Sir,” the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand, “it is improbable that \nyou are not mistaken; but why insist on the truth?”—",
    "Hollingdale": "There are still harmless self-observers who believe ‘immediate certainties’ exist, for \nexample ‘I think’ or, as was Schopenhauer's superstition, ‘I will’: as though \nknowledge here got hold of its object pure and naked, as ‘thing in itself’, and no \nfalsification occurred either on the side of the subject or on that of the object. But \nshall reiterate a hundred times that ‘immediate certainty’, hke ‘absolute knowledge’ \nand ‘thing in itself’, contains a contradictio in adjecto: we really ought to get free \nfrom the seduction of words! Let the people believe that knowledge is total \nknowledge, but the philosopher must say to himself: when I analyse the event \nexpressed in the sentence ‘I think’, I acquire a series of rash assertions which are \ndifficult, perhaps impossible, to prove — for example, that it is J who think, that it \nhas to be something at all which thinks, that thinking is an activity and operation on \nthe part of an entity thought of as a cause, that an T exists, finally that what is \ndesignated by ‘thinking’ has already been determined — that I know what thinking is. \nFor if I had not already decided that matter within myself, by what standard could I \ndetermine that what is happening is not perhaps ‘wilhng’ or ‘feehng’? Enough: this ‘I\nthink’ presupposes that I compare my present state with other known states of \nmyself in order to determine what it is: on account of this retrospective connection \nwith other ‘knowledge’ at any rate it possesses no immediate certainty for me. — In \nplace of that ‘immediate certainty’ in which the people may believe in the present \ncase, the philosopher acquires in this way a series of metaphysical questions, true \nquestions of conscience for the intellect, namely: “Whence do I take the concept \nthinking? Why do I believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right to speak of \nan “I”, and even of an “I” as cause, and finally of an “I” as cause of thought?’ \nWhoever feels able to answer these metaphysical questions straight away with an \nappeal to a sort of intuitive knowledge, as he does who says: ‘I think, and know that \nthis at least is true, actual and certain’ — will find a philosopher today ready with a\nsmile and two question-marks. ‘My dear sir,’ the philosopher will perhaps give him \nto understand, ‘it is improbable you are not mistaken: but why do you want the truth \nat all?” —",
    "Norman": "There are still harmless self-observers who believe in the existence of \n“immediate certainties,” such as “I think,” or the “I will” that was Schopenhauer’s superstition: just as if knowledge had been given an object here \nto seize, stark naked, as a “thing-in-itself,” and no falsification took place \nfrom either the side of the subject or the side of the object. But I will say \nthis a hundred times: “immediate certainty,” hke “absolute knowledge” \nand the “thing in itself” contains a contradictio in adjecto. For once and \nfor all, we should free ourselves from the seduction of words! Let the \npeople believe that knowing means knowing to the very end; the philosopher has to say: “When I dissect the process expressed in the proposition \n15 Reduction to an absurdity (contradiction). \n'6 Cause of itself. \n17 Contradiction in terms.",
    "Faber": "There are still some harmless self-scrutinizers who think that there \nare ‘Immediate certainties’, as for example, ‘I think’, or, in Schopenhauer’s superstition,* ‘I will’—as if perception could grasp its \nobject purely and nakedly as the ‘thing in itself’? without any \nfalsification on the part of the subject or of the object. But I shall \nrepeat a hundred times over that the ‘immediate certainty’, hke \n‘absolute knowledge’ and the ‘thing in itself’, contains a contradictio \nin adjecto:* it’s time people freed themselves from the seduction of \nwords! Let the common people think that perception means \nknowing-to-the-end,* the philosopher must say to himself, ‘If I \nanalyse the process expressed by the proposition “I think”, I get a \nseries of audacious assertions that would be difficult if not impossible to prove; for example, that J am the one who is thinking, that \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers 17 \nthere has to be a something doing the thinking, that thinking is an \nactivity and an effect on the part of a being who is thought of as \na cause, that an “I” exists, and finally, that we by now understand \nclearly what is designated as thinking—that I know what thinking \nis. For if I had not already decided it for myself, how could I \ndetermine that what is going on is not “wilhng” or “feehng”? In \nshort, saying “I think” assumes that I am comparing my present \nstate with other states that I experience in myself, thereby establishing what it is: because of this reference back to another \n“knowledge”, there is, for me at least, no immediate “certainty” \nhere.’ \nThus, instead of that ‘immediate certainty’ that the common \npeople may believe in, the philosopher gets handed a series of \nmetaphysical questions: these are actually the intellect’s questions \nof conscience, such as, ‘Where does my concept of thinking come \nfrom? Why do I believe in cause and effect? What gives me the \nright to talk about an “I”, and beyond that an “I as cause”, and \nbeyond that yet an “I as the cause of thoughts”? Anyone who dares \nto answer such metaphysical questions promptly by referring to a \nkind of epistemological intuition (hke someone who says, ‘I think, \nand know that this at least is true, real, and certain’) will be met \nwith a smile and two question marks by the philosopher of today. \n‘My dear sir,’ the philosopher may suggest, ‘it is improbable that \nyou are not in error, but then why must we insist on truth?’",
