    "Gutenberg": "Gesetzt, dass nichts Anderes als real \"gegeben\" ist als unsre Welt der\nBegierden und Leidenschaften, dass wir zu keiner anderen \"Reahtät\"\nhinab oder hinauf können als gerade zur Reahtät unsrer Triebe - denn\nDenken ist nur ein Verhalten dieser Triebe zu einander -: ist es\nnicht erlaubt, den Versuch zu machen und die Frage zu fragen, ob dies\nGegeben nicht ausreicht, um aus Seines-Gleichen auch die sogenannte\nmechanistische (oder \"materielle\") Welt zu verstehen? Ich meine\nnicht als eine Täuschung, einen \"Schein\", eine \"Vorstellung\" (im\nBerkeley'schen und Schopenhauerischen Sinne), sondem als vom\ngleichen Reahtäts-Range, welchen unser Affekt selbst hat, - als eine\nprimitivere Form der Welt der Affekte, in der noch Alles in mächtiger\nEinheit beschlossen hegt, was sich dann im organischen Prozesse\nabzweigt und ausgestaltet (auch, wie bilhg, verzärtelt und abschwächt\n-), als eine Art von Triebleben, in dem noch sämmthche organische\nFunktionen, mit Selbst-Reguhrung, Assimilation, Emährung,\nAusscheidung, Stoffwechsel, synthetisch gebunden in einander sind,\n- als eine Vorform des Lebens? - Zuletzt ist es nicht nur erlaubt,\ndiesen Versuch zu machen: es ist, vom Gewissen der Methode aus,\n\ngeboten. Nicht mehrere Arten von Causahtät annehmen, so lange nicht\nder Versuch, mit einer einzigen auszureichen, bis an seine äusserste\nGrenze getrieben ist (- bis zum Unsinn, mit Verlaub zu sagen): das ist\neine Moral der Methode, der man sich heute nicht entziehen darf; - es\nfolgt \"aus ihrer Definition\", wie ein Mathematiker sagen würde. Die\nFrage ist zuletzt, ob wir den Willen wirkhch als wirkend anerkennen,\nob wir an die Causahtät des Willens glauben: thun wir das - und im\nGrunde ist der Glaube daran eben unser Glaube an Causahtät selbst -,\nso müssen wir den Versuch machen, die Willens-Causahtät hypothetisch\nals die einzige zu setzen. \"Wille\" kann natürhch nur auf \"Wille\"\nwirken - und nicht auf \"Stoffe\" (nicht auf \"Nerven\" zum Beispiel -):\ngenug, man muss die Hypothese wagen, ob nicht überall, wo \"Wirkungen\"\nanerkannt werden, Wille auf Wille wirkt - und ob nicht alles\nmechanische Geschehen, insofem eine Kraft darin thätig wird, eben\nWillenskraft, Willens-Wirkung ist. - Gesetzt endhch, dass es gelänge,\nunser gesammtes Triebleben als die Ausgestaltung und Verzweigung Einer\nGrundform des Willens zu erklären - nämhch des Willens zur Macht, wie\nes in ein Satz ist -; gesetzt, dass man alle organischen Funktionen\nauf diesen Willen zur Macht zurückführen könnte und in ihm auch die\nLösung des Problems der Zeugung und Emährung - es ist Ein Problemfände, so hätte man damit sich das Recht verschafft, alle wirkende\nKraft eindeutig zu bestimmen als: Wille zur Macht. Die Welt von innen\ngesehen, die Welt auf ihren \"intelhgiblen Charakter\" hin bestimmt und\nbezeichnet - sie wäre eben \"Wille zur Macht\" und nichts ausserdem. -",
    "Kaufmann": "Suppose nothing else were “given” as real except our world of \ndesires and passions, and we could not get down, or up, to any \nother “reality” besides the reality of our drives—for thinking is \nmerely a relation of these drives to cach other: is it not permitted to \nmake the experiment and to ask the question whether this “given” \nwould not be sufficient for also understanding on the basis of this \nkind of thing the so-called mechanistic (or “material”) world? I \nmean, not as a deception, as “mere appearance,” an “idea” (in the \nsense of Berkeley and Schopenhauer) but as holding the same rank \nof reality as our affect—as a more primitive form of the world of \naffects in which everything still hes contained in a powerful unity \n37 Cf.: “It might be amusing, perhaps even instructive, to compare Ryle on \nordinary language with W, D. Ross on prima facie duties, There is a close \nresemblance between Oxford deontology and Oxford linguisticism, not least \nin the assumption that duties, hke verbal habits, are ‘leamt in the nursery’ \n[Ryle’s phrase], and that what nurse has told us goes for the rest of the \nworld, too” (John Passmore, “Professor Ryle’s Use of ‘Use’ and \"Usage,\" \nThe Philosophical Review, LXII [January 1954], 62). \n48 “He seeks the true only to do the good.\" \n48 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \n\n\nbefore it undergoes ramifications and developments in the organic \nprocess (and, as is only fair, also becomes tenderer and weaker) \n—as a kind of instinctive life in which all organic functions are still \nsynthetically intertwined along with self-regulation, assimilation, \nnourishment, excretion, and metabohsm—as a pre-form of life. \nIn the end not only is it permitted to make this experiment; the \nconscience of method demands it. Not to assume several kinds of \ncausahty until the experiment of making do with a single one has \nbeen pushed to its utmost limit (to the point of nonsense, if I may \nsay so)—that is a moral of method which one may not shirk today \n—it follows “from its definition,” as a mathematician would say. \nThe question is in the end whether we really recognize the will as \nefficient, whether we believe in the causahty of the will: if we do \n-—and at bottom our faith in this is nothing less than our faith in \ncausahty itself—then we have to make the experiment of positing \nthe causahty of the will hypothetically as the only one. “Will,” of \ncourse, can affect only “will”—and not “matter” (not “nerves,” for \nexample). In short, one has to risk the hypothesis whether will \ndoes not affect will wherever “effects” are recognized—and \nwhether all mechanical occurrences are not, insofar as a force is \nactive in them, will force, effects of will. \nSuppose, finally, we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and ramification of one basic form \nof the will—namely, of the will to power, as my proposition has \nit; suppose all organic functions could be traced back to this will to \npower and one could also find in it the solution of the problem of \nprocreation and nourishment—it is one problem—then one would \nhave gained the right to determine all efficient force univocally as \n—-will to power. The world viewed from inside, the world defined \nand determined according to its “intelhgible character”\"—it would \nbe “will to power” and nothing else—",
    "Hollingdale": "Granted that nothing is ‘given’ as real except our world of desires and passions, that \nwe can rise or sink to no other ‘reality’ than the reality of our drives — for thinking\nonly the relationship of these drives to one another - : is it not permitted to make \nthe experiment and ask the question whether this which is given does not suffice for \nan understanding even of the so-called mechanical (or ‘material’) world? I do not \nmean as a deception, an ‘appearance’, an ‘idea’ (in the Berkeleyan and \nSchopenhaueran sense), but as possessing the same degree of reality as our \nemotions themselves — as a more primitive form of the world of emotions in which \neverything still hes locked in mighty unity and then branches out and develops in \nthe organic process (also, as is only fair, is made weaker and more sensitive), as a \nkind of instinctual life in which all organic functions, together with self-regulation,\nassimilation, nourishment, excretion, metabohsm, are still synthetically bound \ntogether — as an antecedent form of life? — In the end, it is not merely permitted to \nmake this experiment: it is commanded by the conscience of method. Not to assume \nseveral kinds of causahty so long as the experiment of getting along with one has \nnot been taken to its ultimate limits (— to the point of nonsense, if I may say so): \nthat is a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadays — it follows \n‘from its definition’, as a mathematician would say. In the end, the question is \nwhether we really recognize will as efficient, whether we believe in the causahty of \nwill: if we do so — and fundamentally belief in this is precisely our belief in \ncausahty itself — then we have to make the experiment of positing causahty of will \nhypothetically as the only one. ‘Will’ can of course operate only on ‘will’ — and not \non ‘matter’ (not on ‘nerves’, for example —): enough, one must venture the \nhypothesis that wherever ‘effects’ are recognized, will is operating upon will — and \nthat all mechanical occurrences, in so far as a force is active in them, are force of \nwill, effects of will. — Granted finally that one succeeded in explaining our entire \ninstinctual life as the development and ramification of one basic form of will — as \nwill to power, as is my theory — ; granted that one could trace all organic functions \nback to this will to power and could also find in it the solution to the problem of \nprocreation and nourishment — they are one problem — one would have acquired the \nright to define all efficient force unequivocally as: will to power. The world seen \nfrom within, the world described and defined according to its ‘intelhgible character’ \n— it would be ‘will to power’ and nothing else. —",
    "Norman": "Assuming that our world of desires and passions is the only thing “given” \nas real, that we cannot get down or up to any “reality” except the reality of \nour drives (since thinking is only a relation between these drives) — aren't \nwe allowed to make the attempt and pose the question as to whether \nsomething hke this *given\" isn't enough to render the so-called mechanistic (and thus material) world comprehensible as well? I do not mean \ncomprehensible as a deception, a “mere appearance,” a “representation” \n13 Values. \n™ “He looks for truth only to do good.”",
    "Faber": "Assuming that nothing real is ‘given’ to us apart from our world \nof desires and passions, assuming that we cannot ascend or descend \nto any ‘reality’ other than the reality of our instincts (for thinking \nis merely an interrelation of these instincts, one to the other), may \nwe not be allowed to perform an experiment and ask whether \nthis ‘given’ also provides a sufficient explanation for the so-called \nmechanistic (or ‘material’) world? I do not mean the material world \nas a delusion, as ‘appearance’ or ‘representation’ (in the Berkeleian \nor Schopenhauerian sense), but rather as a world with the same \n\n\nlevel of reality that our emotion has—that is, as a more rudimentary \nform of the world of emotions, holding everything in a powerful \n36 Beyond Good and Evil \nunity, all the potential of the organic process to develop and differentiate (and spoil and weaken, too, of course), as a kind of instinctual \nlife in which all the organic functions (self-regulation, adaptation, \nahmentation, ehmination, metabohsm) are synthetically hnked to \none another—as a prehminary form of life? \nIn the end, we are not only allowed to perform such an experiment, we are commanded to do so by the conscience of our method. \nWe must not assume that there are several sorts of causahty until \nwe have tested the possibility that one alone will suffice, tested it \nto its furthest limits (to the point of nonsense, if you'll allow me to \nsay so). We cannot evade this morality of method today: it follows \n‘by definition’, as a mathematician would say. The question is \nultimately whether we really recognize that the will can effect things, \nwhether we believe in the causahty of the will: if we do (and to \nbelieve in this is basically to believe in causahty itself), we must \nexperiment to test hypothetically whether the causahty of the will \nis the only causahty. A ‘will can have an effect only upon another \n‘will, of course, and not upon ‘matter’ (not upon ‘nerves’, for \nexample): one must dare to hypothesize, in short, that wherever \n‘effects’ are identified, a will is having an effect upon another will— \nand that all mechanical events, in so far as an energy is active in \nthem, are really the energy of the will, the effect of the will. \nAssuming, finally, that we could explain our entire instinctual \nlife as the development and differentiation of one basic form of the \nwill (namely the will to power, as my tenet would have it); assuming \nthat one could derive all organic functions from this will to power \nand also find in it the solution to the problem of procreation and \nahmentation (it is all one problem), then we would have won the \nright to designate all effective energy unequivocally as: the will to \npower. The world as it is seen from the inside, the world defined \nand described by its ‘intelhgible character’**—would be simply ‘will \nto power’ and that alone.—",
