    "Gutenberg": "Man verehrt und verachtet in jungen Jahren noch ohne jene Kunst der\nNuance, welche den besten Gewinn des Lebens ausmacht, und muss es\nbilhgerweise hart büssen, solchergestalt Menschen und Dinge mit Ja\nund Nein überfallen zu haben. Es ist Alles darauf eingerichtet, dass\nder schlechteste aller Geschmäcker, der Geschmack für das Unbedingte\ngrausam genarrt und gemissbraucht werde, bis der Mensch lemt, etwas\nKunst in seine Gefühle zu legen und heber noch mit dem Künsthchen\nden Versuch zu wagen: wie es die rechten Artisten des Lebens thun. Das\nZomige und Ehrfürchtige, das der Jugend eignet, scheint sich keine\nRuhe zu geben, bevor es nicht Menschen und Dinge so zurecht gefälscht\nhat, dass es sich an ihnen auslassen kann: - Jugend ist an sich schon\netwas Fälschendes und Betrügerisches. Später, wenn die junge Seele,\ndurch lauter Enttäuschungen gemartert, sich endhch argwöhnisch\ngegen sich selbst zurück wendet, immer noch heiss und wild, auch in\nihrem Argwohne und Gewissensbisse: wie zümt sie sich nunmehr, wie\nzerreisst sie sich ungeduldig, wie nimmt sie Rache für ihre lange\nSelbst-Verblendung, wie als ob sie eine willkürhche Blindheit gewesen\nsei! In diesem Übergange bestraft man sich selber, durch Misstrauen\ngegen sein Gefühl; man foltert seine Begeisterung durch den Zweifel,\nja man fühlt schon das gute Gewissen als eine Gefahr, gleichsam als\nSelbst-Verschleierung und Ermüdung der feineren Redhchkeit; und vor\nAllem, man nimmt Partei, grundsätzhch Partei gegen \"die Jugend\".Ein Jahrzehend später: und man begreift, dass auch dies Alles nochJugend war!",
    "Kaufmann": "When one is young, one venerates and despises without that \nart of nuances which constitutes the best gain of life, and it is only \nfair that one has to pay dearly for having assaulted men and things \nin this manner with Yes and No, Everything is arranged so that \nthe worst of tastes, the taste for the unconditional, should be cruelly fooled and abused until a man leams to put a httle art into his \nfeehngs and rather to risk trying even what is artificial—as the real \nartists of life do, \nThe wrathful and reverent attitudes characteristic of youth \ndo not seem to permit themselves any rest until they have forged \nmen and things in such a way that these attitudes may be vented on \nthem—after all, youth in itself has something of forgery and deception, Later, when the young soul, tortured by all kinds of disappointments, finally tums suspiciously against itself, still hot and \nwild, even in its suspicion and pangs of conscience—how.wroth it \nis with itself now! how it tears itself to pieces, impatiently! how it \ntakes revenge for its long self-delusion, just as if it had been a dehberate blindness! In this transition one punishes oneself with mistrust against one’s own feehngs; one tortures one’s own enthusiasm \nWith doubts; indeed, one experiences even a good conscience as a \ndanger, as’if it were a way of wrapping oneself in veils and the exhaustion of subtler honesty—and above all one takes sides, takes \nsides on principle, against “youth.”— Ten years later one comprehends that all this, too—was still youth,",
    "Hollingdale": "In our youthful years we respect and despise without that art of nuance which \nconstitutes the best thing we gain from life, and, as is only fair, we have to pay \ndearly for having assailed men and things with Yes and No in such a fashion. \nEverything is so regulated that the worst of all tastes, the taste for the unconditiona\nis cruelly misused and made a fool of until a man leams to introduce a httle art into\nhis feehngs and even to venture trying the artificial: as genuine artists of life do. \nanger and reverence characteristic of youth seem to allow themselves no peace until \nthey have falsified men and things in such a way that they can vent themselves on \nthem — youth as such is something that falsifies and deceives. Later, when the \nyouthful soul, tormented by disappointments, finally tums suspiciously on itself, stil\nhot and savage even in its suspicion and pangs of conscience: how angry it is with \nitself now, how it impatiently rends itself, how it takes revenge for its long selfdelusion, as if it had blinded itself dehberately! During this transition one punishes\noneself by distrusting one's feehngs; one tortures one's enthusiasm with doubts, \nindeed one feels that even a good conscience is a danger, as though a good \nconscience were a screening of oneself and a sign that one's subtler honesty had \ngrown weary; and above all one takes sides, takes sides on principle, against ‘youth’. \n— A decade later: and one grasps that all this too — was still youth!",
    "Norman": "When people are young, they admire and despise without any of that art \nof nuance which is life’s greatest reward; so it is only fair that they will \ncome to pay dearly for having assaulted people and things hke this, with \na Yes and a No. Everything is set up so that the worst possible taste, the \n1° [n German: nicht dafür geartet. The term geartet is related to the German word Art (\nappears frequently in this section as well as throughout the text. \n™ Tn German: dass er entartete.",
    "Faber": "When we are young, we revere and revile without benefit of the \nart of the nuance, life’s greatest prize; and it is only fair that we \nmust later repent bitterly for having pounced upon people and \nthings with a Yes or a No. Everything is designed so that the worst \nof all possible tastes, our taste for the unconditional, is terribly and \nfoolishly abused, until we leam to put some art into our feehngs \nand even take a chance with artifice—as do the real artists of life. \nYoung people, with their characteristic anger and awe, seem to find \nno peace until they have neatly falsified people and things, so that \nthey can vent their feehngs on them: youth by its very nature is \nsomething falsifying and deceptive. Later, after our young soul has \nbeen tormented by unrelieved disappointments and finally tums \nsuspiciously back upon itself, still hot and wild even in its suspicion \nand pangs of conscience, then how angry we are, how impatiently \n32 Beyond Good and Evil \nwe tear ourselves apart, taking vengeance for having deluded ourselves for so long, as if our delusion had been voluntary! When we \nmake this transition, we punish ourselves by distrusting our feelings; we torture our enthusiasm with doubt, indeed we even \nexperience our good conscience as a danger, as if it were veihng us \nor wearing down our finer honesty: and above all else we take sides, \non principle, take sides against ‘youth’. \nA decade later, and we understand that this whole process, too, \nwas—youth!",
    "Zimmern": "i \nIn our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the art of nuance, which is the best gain of life, and we \nhave rightly to do hard penance for having fallen upon men \nand things with Yea and Nay. Everything is so arranged \nthat the worst of all tastes, the taste for the unconditional, \nis cruelly befooled and abused, until a man leams to introduce a httle art into his sentiments, and prefers to try conclusions with the artificial, as do the real artists of life. \nThe angry and reverent spirit pecuhar to youth appears to \nallow itself no peace, until it has suitably falsified men and \nthings, to be able to vent its passion upon them: youth in \nitself even, is something falsifying and deceptive. Later on, \nwhen the young soul, tortured by continual disillusions, \nfinally tums suspiciously against itself — still ardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of conscience: how it \nupbraids itself, how impatiently it tears itself, how it revenges itself for its long self-blinding, as though it had been \na voluntary blindness! In this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one's sentiments; one tortures one's enthusiasm with doubt, one feels even the good conscience \nto be a danger, as if it were the self-concealment and lassitude of a more refined uprightness; and above all, one \nespouses upon principle the cause against \"youth.\" — A decade later, and one comprehends that all this was also still-youth!"
