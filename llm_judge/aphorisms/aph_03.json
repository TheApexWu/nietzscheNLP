    "Gutenberg": "Nachdem ich lange genug den Philosophen zwischen die Zeilen und auf\ndie Finger gesehn habe, sage ich mir: man muss noch den grössten Theil\ndes bewussten Denkens unter die Instinkt-Thätigkeiten rechnen, und\nsogar im Falle des philosophischen Denkens; man muss hier umlemen,\nwie man in Betreff der Vererbung und des \"Angeborenen\" umgelemt hat.\nSo wenig der Akt der Geburt in dem ganzen Vor- und Fortgange der\nVererbung in Betracht kommt: ebenso wenig ist \"Bewusstsein\" in irgend\neinem entscheidenden Sinne dem Instinktiven entgegengesetzt, - das\nmeiste bewusste Denken eines Philosophen ist durch seine Instinkte\nheimhch geführt und in bestimmte Bahnen gezwungen. Auch hinter aller\nLogik und ihrer anscheinenden Selbstherrhchkeit der Bewegung stehen\nWerthschätzungen, deuthcher gesprochen, physiologische Forderungen\nzur Erhaltung einer bestimmten Art von Leben. Zum Beispiel, dass das\nBestimmte mehr werth sei als das Unbestimmte, der Schein weniger werth\nals die \"Wahrheit\": dergleichen Schätzungen könnten, bei aller ihrer\nregulativen Wichtigkeit für uns, doch nur Vordergrunds-Schätzungen\nsein, eine bestimmte Art von niaiserie, wie sie gerade zur Erhaltung\nvon Wesen, wie wir sind, noth thun mag. Gesetzt nämhch, dass nicht\ngerade der Mensch das \"Maass der Dinge\" ist.....",
    "Kaufmann": "After having looked long enough between the philosophers \nhnes and fingers, I say to myself: by far the greater part of conscious thinking must still be included among instinctive activities, \nand that goes even for philosophical thinking. We have to releam \nhere, as one has had to releam about heredity and what is “innate.” \nAs the act of birth deserves no consideration in the whole process \nand procedure of heredity, so “being conscious” is not in any decisive sense the opposite of what is instinctive: most of the conscious \nthinking of a philosopher is secretly guided and forced into certain \nchannels by his instincts. \nBehind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement, too, \n\n\nthere stand valuations or, more clearly, physiological demands for \nthe preservation of a certain type of life. For example, that the definite should be worth more than the indefinite, and mere appearance worth less than “truth”-—such estimates might be, in spite of \ntheir regulative importance for us, nevertheless mere foreground \nestimates, a certain kind of niaiserie* which may be necessary for \nthe preservation of just such beings as we are. Supposing, that is, \nthat not just man is the “measure of things” —",
    "Hollingdale": "Having kept a close eye on philosophers and read between their hnes for a sufficient \nlength of time, I tell myself: the greater part of conscious thinking must still be \ncounted among the instinctive activities, and this is so even in the case of \nphilosophical thinking; we have to leam differently here as we have leamed \ndifferently in regard to heredity and the ‘innate’. Just as the act of being bom plays\nno part in the procedure and progress of heredity, so ‘being conscious’ is in no \ndecisive sense the opposite of the instinctive — most of a philosopher's conscious \nthinking is secretly directed and compelled into definite channels by his instincts. \nBehind all logic too and its apparent autonomy there stand evaluations, in plainer \nterms physiological demands for the preservation of a certain species of life. For \nexample, that the definite shall be of greater value than the indefinite, appearance of\nless value than ‘truth’: but such valuations as these could, their regulatory \nimportance for us notwithstanding, be no more than foreground valuations, a certain \nspecies of niaiserie which may be necessary precisely for the preservation of beings \nsuch as us. Assuming, that is to say, that it is not precisely man who is the ‘measure \nof things’...",
    "Norman": "I have kept a close eye on the philosophers and read between their hnes \nfor long enough to say to myself: the greatest part of conscious thought \n1 Cf. Human, All too Human, I, $1. \n? Everything is to be doubted. \nOn the prejudices of philosophers \nmust still be attributed to instinctive activity, and this is even the case for \nphilosophical thought. This issue needs re-examination in the same way \nthat heredity and “innate characteristics” have been re-examined. Just \nas the act of birth makes no difference to the overall course of heredity, \nneither is “consciousness” opposed to instinct in any decisive sense — most \nof a philosopher’s conscious thought is secretly directed and forced into \ndeterminate channels by the instincts. Even behind all logic and its autocratic posturings stand valuations or, stated more clearly, physiological \nrequirements for the preservation ofa particular type of life. For example, \nthat the determinate is worth more than the indeterminate, appearance \nworth less than the “truth”: despite all their regulative importance for \nus, these sorts of appraisals could still be just foreground appraisals, a \nparticular type of miaiserie,3 precisely what is needed for the preservation \nof beings hke us. But this assumes that it is not man who is the “measure \n\n\nof things”...",
    "Faber": "Having long kept a strict eye on the philosophers, and having \nlooked between their hnes, I say to myself: the largest part of \nconscious thinking has to be considered an instinctual activity, even \nin the case of philosophical thinking; we need a new understanding \nhere, just as we’ve come to a new understanding of heredity and \nthe ‘innate’. Just as the act of birth is scarcely relevant to the entire \nprocess and progress of heredity, so ‘consciousness’ is scarcely \nopposite to the instincts in any decisive sense—most of a philosopher’s conscious thinking is secretly guided and channelled into \nparticular tracks by his instincts. Behind all logic, too, and its \napparent tyranny of movement there are value judgements, or to \nspeak more clearly, physiological demands for the preservation of a \n\n\nparticular kind of life. That a certainty is worth more than an \nuncertainty, for example, or that appearance is worth less than \n‘truth’: whatever their regulatory importance for us, such evaluations might still be nothing but foreground evaluations, a certain \nkind of miaiserie,* as is required for the preservation of beings hke \nus. Given, that is, that man is not necessarily the ‘measure of all \nthings* ...",
