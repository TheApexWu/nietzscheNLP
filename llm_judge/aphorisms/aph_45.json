    "Gutenberg": "Die menschhche Seele und ihre Grenzen, der bisher überhaupt erreichte\nUmfang menschhcher innerer Erfahrungen, die Höhen, Tiefen und Femen\ndieser Erfahrungen, die ganze bisherige Geschichte der Seele und ihre\nnoch unausgetrunkenen Möghchkeiten: das ist für einen geborenen\nPsychologen und Freund der \"grossen Jagd\" das vorbestimmte\nJagdbereich. Aber wie oft muss er sich verzweifelt sagen: \"ein\nEinzelner! ach, nur ein Einzelner! und dieser grosse Wald und Urwald!\"\nUnd so wünscht er sich einige hundert Jagdgehülfen und feine gelehrte\nSpürhunde, welche er in die Geschichte der menschhchen Seele treiben\nkönnte, um dort sein Wild zusammenzutreiben. Umsonst: er erprobt es\nimmer wieder, gründhch und bitterhch, wie schlecht zu allen Dingen,\ndie gerade seine Neugierde reizen, Gehülfen und Hunde zu finden\nsind. Der Übelstand, den es hat, Gelehrte auf neue und gefährhche\nJagdbereiche auszuschicken, wo Muth, Klugheit, Feinheit in jedem Sinne\nnoth thun, hegt darin, dass sie gerade dort nicht mehr brauchbar\nsind, wo die \"grosse Jagd\", aber auch die grosse Gefahr beginnt:gerade dort verheren sie ihr Spürauge und ihre Spümase. Um zum\nBeispiel zu errathen und festzustellen, was für eine Geschichte bisher\ndas Problem von Wissen und Gewissen in der Seele der homines rehgiosi\ngehabt hat, dazu müsste Einer vielleicht selbst so tief, so verwundet,\nso ungeheuer sein, wie es das intellektuelle Gewissen Pascal's war:\nund dann bedürfte es immer noch jenes ausgespannten Himmels von\nheller, boshafter Geistigkeit, welcher von Oben herab dies Gewimmel\nvon gefährhchen und schmerzhchen Erlebnissen zu übersehn, zu ordnen,\nin Formeln zu zwingen vermöchte. - Aber wer thäte mir diesen Dienst!\nAber wer hätte Zeit, auf solche Diener zu warten! - sie wachsen\nersichthch zu selten, sie sind zu allen Zeiten so unwahrscheinhch!\nZuletzt muss man Alles selber thun, um selber Einiges zu wissen: das\nheisst, man hat viel zu thun! - Aber eine Neugierde meiner Art bleibt\nnun einmal das angenehmste aller Laster, - Verzeihung! ich wollte\nsagen: die Liebe zur Wahrheit hat ihren Lohn im Himmel und schon auf\nErden. -",
    "Kaufmann": "The human soul and its limits, the range of inner human experiences reached so far, the heights, depths, and distances of these experiences, the whole history of the soul so far and its as yet unexhausted possibihties—that is the predestined hunting ground for \na bom psychologist and lover of the “great hunt.” But how often he \nhas to say to himself in despair: “One hunter! alas, only a single \none! and look at this huge forest, this primeval forest!” And then ho \nwishes he had a few hundred helpers and good, well-trained \nhounds that he could drive into the history of the human soul to \nround up his game. In vain: it is proved to him again and again, \nthoroughly and bitterly, how helpers and hounds for all the things \nthat excite his curiosity cannot be found. What is wrong with \nsending scholars into new and dangerous hunting grounds, where \ncourage, sense, and subtlety in every way are required, is that they \ncease to be of any use precisely where the “great hunt,” but also the \ngreat danger, begins: precisely there they lose their keen eyo and \nNoses \nTo figure out and determine, for example, what kind of a history the problem of science and conscience? has so far had in the \nsoul of homines rehgiosi, one might perhaps have to be as profound, as wounded, as monstrous as Pascal’s intellectual conscience \nwas—and then one would still need that vaulting heaven of bright, \nmahcious spirituality that would be capable of surveying from \nabove, arranging, and forcing into formulas this swarm of dangerous and painful experiences, \nBut who would do me this service?

    "Hollingdale": "The human soul and its frontiers, the compass of human inner experience in general \nattained hitherto, the heights, depths and distances of this experience, the entire \nhistory of the soul hitherto and its still unexhausted possibihties: this is the \npredestined hunting-ground for a bom psychologist and lover of the ‘big-game \nhunt’. But how often must he say despairingly to himself: ‘one man! alas, but one \nman! and this great forest and jungle!’ And thus he wishes he had a few hundred \nbeaters and subtle well-instructed tracker dogs whom he could send into the history \nof the human soul and there round up his game. In vain: he discovers again and \nagain, thoroughly and bitterly, how hard it is to find beaters and dogs for all the \nthings which arouse his curiosity. The drawback in sending scholars out into new \nand dangerous hunting-grounds where courage, prudence, subtlety in every sense \nare needed is that they cease to be of any use precisely where the ‘big hunt’, but also\nthe big danger, begins — precisely there do they lose their keenness of eye and \nkeenness of nose. To divine and establish, for example, what sort of history the \nproblem of knowledge and conscience has had in the soul of bomines rehgiosi one \nwould oneself perhaps have to be as profound, as wounded, as monstrous as Pascal's \nintellectual conscience was — and then there would still be needed that broad heaven \nof bright, mahcious spirituality capable of looking down on this turmoil of \ndangerous and painful experiences, surveying and ordering them and forcing them \ninto formulas. — But who could do me this service! And who could have the time to \nwait for such servants! — they appear too rarely, they are at all times so very \nimprobable! In the end one has to do everything oneself if one is to know a few \nthings oneself: that is to say, one has much to do! — But a curiosity hke mine is afte\nall the most pleasurable of vices — I beg your pardon! I meant to say: the love of \ntruth has its reward in Heaven, and already upon earth. —",
    "Norman": "The human soul and its limits, the scope of human inner experience to \ndate, the heights, depths, and range of these experiences, the entire history \nof the soul so far and its still unexhausted possibihties: these are the \npredestined hunting grounds for a bom psychologist and lover of the \n“great hunt.” But how often does he have to tum to himself in despair \nand say: “Only one! only a single one! and this huge forest, this primeval \nforest!” And then he wishes he had a few hundred hunting aides and welltrained bloodhounds he could drive into the history of the human soul to \nround up Ais game. To no avail: time and again he gets an ample and bitter \nreminder of how hard it is to find hounds and helpers for the very things \nthat prick his curiosity. The problem with sending scholars into new and \ndangerous hunting grounds, where courage, intelligence, and subtlety in \nevery sense are needed, is that they stop being useful the very moment the \n“great hunt\" (but also the great danger) begins: — this is just when they lose \ntheir sharp eye and keen nose. For instance, it might take somebody who \nis himself as deep, as wounded, and as monstrous as Pascal's intellectual \nconscience to figure out the sort of history that the problem of science \nand conscience has had in the soul of homines rehgiosi! so far. And, even \nthen, such a person would still need that vaulting sky of bright, mahcious \nspirituality from whose heights this throng of dangerous and painful \nexperiences could be surveyed, ordered, and forced into formulas. — But \nwho would do me this service! But who would have the time to wait \nfor such servants! — it is clear that they grow too rarely; they are so \n' Religious people.",
    "Faber": "THE human soul and its boundaries; the dimensions that the human \ninner life has thus far attained, its peaks, valleys, and distances; \nthe whole previous history of the soul and its as yet unexplored \npossibihties—for a bom psychologist and lover of the ‘great hunt’, \nthis is his preordained hunting ground. But how often, despairingly, \nmust he say to himself: ‘I am one man alone! Only one man alone, \nin this great, primeval forest!’ And he wishes he had a few hundred \nhelpers for the hunt and some well-schooled, fine-nosed bloodhounds to chase into the history of the human soul and flush out \nhis game for him. In vain: again and again he discovers, bitterly \nand absolutely, how difficult it is to find hounds or helpers for just \nthose things that pique his curiosity. There is no advantage to \nsending scholars out into new and dangerous hunting grounds, \nwhere courage, clevemess, and subtlety are required in every \nsense, where the ‘great hunt’ (but also the great danger) begins, for \nscholars are no longer useful there: rather, that is just where they \nlose their keen eye and sensitive nose. To intuit and establish the \nhistory of the problem of cognizance and conscience* in the soul of \nhomines rehgiosi,* for example, you might yourself have to be as \ndeep, as wounded, as monstrous as was the intellectual conscience \nof Pascal.* And even then you would still have need of that vast \nbreadth of sky above with its bright, mahcious spirituality to survey \nthis multitude of dangerous, painful experiences, order them, and \nforce them into formulae. \nBut who could render me this service! And who would have time \nto wait for such servants to appear! Clearly, they tum up too rarely, \nfinding them is always so improbable!

The \nevil of sending scholars into new and dangerous huntingdomains, where courage, sagacity, and subtlety in every \nsense are required, is that they are no longer serviceable \njust when the \"big hunt,\" and also the great danger commences,— it is precisely then that they lose their keen eye \nand nose.
