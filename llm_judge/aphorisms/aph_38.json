    "Gutenberg": "Wie es zuletzt noch, in aller Helhgkeit der neueren Zeiten, mit der\nfranzösischen Revolution gegangen ist, jener schauerhchen und, aus\nder Nähe beurtheilt, überflüssigen Posse, in welche aber die edlen und\nschwärmerischen Zuschauer von ganz Europa aus der Feme her so lange\nund so leidenschafthch ihre eignen Empörungen und Begeisterungen\nhinein interpretirt haben, bis der Text unter der Interpretation\nverschwand: so könnte eine edle Nachwelt noch einmal die ganze\nVergangenheit missverstehen und dadurch vielleicht erst ihren Anbhck\nerträghch machen. - Oder vielmehr: ist dies nicht bereits geschehen?\nwaren wir nicht selbst - diese \"edle Nachwelt\"? Und ist es nicht\ngerade jetzt, insofem wir dies begreifen, - damit vorbei?",
    "Kaufmann": "What happened most recently in the broad daylight of modem times in the case of the French Revolution—that gruesome \nfarce which, considered closely, was quite superfluous, though noble and enthusiastic spectators from all over Europe contemplated \nit from a distance and interpreted it according to their own indignations and enthusiasms for so long, and so passionately, that the text \nfinally disappeared under the interpretation—could happen once \nmore as a noble posterity might misunderstand the whole past and \nin that way alone make it tolerable to look at. \nOr rather: isn’t this what has happened even now? haven't we \nourselves been this “noble posterity’? And isn’t now precisely the \nmoment when, insofar as we comprehend this, it is all over?",
    "Hollingdale": "As happened lately, in all the clarity of modem times, with the French Revolution, \nthat gruesome and, closely considered, superfluous farce, into which, however, \nnoble and enthusiastic spectators all over Europe interpeted from a distance their \nown indignations and raptures so long and so passionately that the text disappeared \nbeneath the interpretation: so a noble posterity could once again misunderstand the \nentire past and only thus perhaps make the sight of it endurable. — Or rather: has \nthis not already happened? have we ourselves not been this ‘noble posterity’? And, \nin so far as we comprehend this, is it not at this moment — done with?",
    "Norman": "This is what has finally happened, in the bright light of more recent times, \nto the French Revolution, that gruesome and (on close consideration) \npointless farce: noble and enthusiastic spectators across Europe have, \nfrom a distance, interpreted their own indignations and enthusiasms into \nit, and for so long and with such passion that the text has finally disappeared \n\n\nunder the interpretation. In the same way, a noble posterity could again \nmisunderstand the entire past, and in so doing, perhaps, begin to make \nit tolerable to look at. — Or rather: hasn't this happened already? weren't \nwe ourselves this “noble posterity”? And right now, since we're reahzing \nthis to be the case — hasn't it stopped being so?",
    "Faber": "Take what has happened recently, in the full light of our modem \nage, with the French Revolution, that gruesome and (judged from \nclose up) superfluous farce: its noble and inspired spectators \nthroughout Europe have been projecting their own rebelhous and \nenthusiastic feehngs onto it from afar for so long and with such \npassion that the text has disappeared undemeath the interpretation. A \nnoble posterity might one day misunderstand all of past history in \na similar way, and only in so doing make the sight of it bearable. \nOr rather: hasn’t this already happened? Haven’t we ourselves \nbeen this ‘noble posterity’? And since we now recognize what we \nhave been doing, can’t we—stop it?",
    "Zimmern": "I \nAs happened finally in all the enlightenment of modem \ntimes with the French Revolution (that terrible farce, quite \nsuperfluous when judged close at hand, into which, however, \nthe noble and visionary spectators of all Europe have interpreted from a distance their own indignation and enthusiasm \nso long and passionately, until the text has disappeared under the interpretation), so a noble posterity might once \nmore misunderstand the whole of the past, and perhaps only \nthereby make its aspect endurable. — Or rather, has not this \nalready happened? Have not we ourselves been — that \n\"noble posterity\"? And, in so far as we now comprehend \nthis, is it not — thereby already past?"
