    "Gutenberg": "\"Gemäss der Natur\" wollt ihr leben? Oh ihr edlen Stoiker, welche\nBetrügerei der Worte! Denkt euch ein Wesen, wie es die Natur ist,\nverschwenderisch ohne Maass, gleichgültig ohne Maass, ohne Absichten\nund Rücksichten, ohne Erbarmen und Gerechtigkeit, fruchtbar und öde\nund ungewiss zugleich, denkt euch die Indifferenz selbst als Macht\n- wie könntet ihr gemäss dieser Indifferenz leben? Leben - ist\ndas nicht gerade ein Anders-sein-wollen, als diese Natur ist? Ist\nLeben nicht Abschätzen, Vorziehn, Ungerechtsein, Begrenzt-sein,\nDifferent-sein-wollen? Und gesetzt, euer Imperativ \"gemäss der Natur\nleben\" bedeute im Grunde soviel als \"gemäss dem Leben leben\" - wie\nkönntet ihr's denn nicht? Wozu ein Princip aus dem machen, was ihr\nselbst seid und sein müsst? - In Wahrheit steht es ganz anders: indem\nihr entzückt den Kanon eures Gesetzes aus der Natur zu lesen vorgebt,\nwollt ihr etwas Umgekehrtes, ihr wunderhchen Schauspieler und\nSelbst-Betrüger! Euer Stolz will der Natur, sogar der Natur, eure\nMoral, euer Ideal vorschreiben und einverleiben, ihr verlangt,\ndass sie \"der Stoa gemäss\" Natur sei und möchtet alles Dasein nur\nnach eurem eignen Bilde dasein machen - als eine ungeheure ewige\nVerherrhchung und Verallgemeinerung des Stoicismus! Mit aller eurer\nLiebe zur Wahrheit zwingt ihr euch so lange, so beharrhch, so\nhypnotisch-starr, die Natur falsch, nämhch stoisch zu sehn, bis ihr\nsie nicht mehr anders zu sehen vermögt, - und irgend ein abgründhcher\nHochmuth giebt euch zuletzt noch die Tollhäusler-Hoffnung ein, dass,\nweil ihr euch selbst zu tyrannisiren versteht - Stoicismus ist\nSelbst-Tyrannei -, auch die Natur sich tyrannisiren lässt: ist denn\nder Stoiker nicht ein Stück Natur? Aber dies ist eine alte ewige\nGeschichte: was sich damals mit den Stoikem begab, begiebt sich heute\nnoch, sobald nur eine Philosophie anfängt, an sich selbst zu glauben.\nSie schafft immer die Welt nach ihrem Bilde, sie kann nicht anders;\nPhilosophie ist dieser tyrannische Trieb selbst, der geistigste Wille\n\nzur Macht, zur \"Schaffung der Welt\", zur causa prima.",
    "Kaufmann": "“According to nature” you want to live? O you noble Stoics, \nwhat deceptive words these are! Imagine a being hke nature, \nwasteful beyond measure, indifferent beyond measure, without \npurposes and consideration, without mercy and justice, fertile and \ndesolate and uncertain at the same time; imagine indifference jtself as a power—how could you live according to this indifference? \nLiving—is that not precisely wanting to be other than this nature? \nIs not hving—estimating, preferring, being unjust, being limited, \nwanting to be different? And supposing your imperative “live according to nature” meant at bottom as much as “live according to \nlife\"—how could you not do that? Why make a principle of what \nyou yourselves are and must be? \nIn truth, the matter is altogether different: while you pretend \nrapturously to read the canon of your law in nature, you want \nsomething opposite, you strange actors and self-deceivers! Your \npride wants to impose your morality, your ideal, on nature—even \non nature—and incorporate them in her; you demand that she \nshould be nature “according to the Stoa,” and you would hke all \n16 “The ass arrived, beautiful and most brave.” \n16 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nexistence to exist only after your own image—as an immense \netemal glorification and generahzation of Stoicism. For all vour love \nof truth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, so \nrigidly-hypnotically to see nature the wrong way, namely Stoically, \nthat you are no longer able to see her differently. And some abysmal arrogance finally still inspires you with the insane hope that \nbecause you know how to tyrannize yourselves—Stoicism is selftyranny—nature, too, lets herself be tyrannized: is not the Stoic— \na piece of nature? \nBut this is an ancient, etemal story: what formerly happened \nwith the Stoics still happens today, too, as soon as any philosophy \nbegins to believe in itself. It always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise. Philosophy is this tyrannical drive itself, the most spiritual will to power, to the “creation of the world,” \nto the causa prima.",
    "Hollingdale": "You want to live ‘according to nature’? O you noble Stoics, what fraudulent words! \nThink of a being such as nature is, prodigal beyond measure, indifferent beyond \nmeasure, without aims or intentions, without mercy or justice, at once fruitful and \nbarren and uncertain; think of indifference itself as a power — how could you live \naccording to such indifference? To live — is that not precisely wanting to be other \nthan this nature? Is hving not valuating, preferring, being unjust, being limited, \nwanting to be different? And even if your imperative ‘live according to nature’ \nmeant at bottom the same thing as ‘live according to life’ — how could you not do \nthat? Why make a principle of what you yourselves are and must be? — The truth of \nit is, however, quite different: while you rapturously pose as deriving the canon of \nyour law from nature, you want something quite the reverse of that, you strange \nactors and self-deceivers! Your pride wants to prescribe your morality, your ideal, \nto nature, yes to nature itself, and incorporate them in it; you demand that nature \n\n\nshould be nature ‘according to the Stoa’ and would hke to make all existence exist \nonly after your own image — as a tremendous etemal glorification and \nuniversahzation of Stoicism! All your love of truth notwithstanding, you have \ncompelled yourselves for so long and with such persistence and hypnotic rigidity to \nview nature falsely, namely Stoically, you are no longer capable of viewing it in any \nother way — and some abysmal arrogance infects you at last with the Bedlamite \nhope that, because you know how to tyrannize over yourselves — Stoicism is selftyranny — nature too can be tyrannized over: for is the Stoic not a piece of nature?...\nBut this is an old and never-ending story: what formerly happened with the Stoics \nstill happens today as soon as a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always \ncreates the world in its own image, it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this \ntyrannical drive itself, the most spiritual will to power, to ‘creation of the world’, \ncausa prima.",
    "Norman": "So you want to /ive “according to nature?” Oh, you noble Stoics, what a \nfraud is in this phrase! Imagine something hke nature, profhgate without measure, indifferent without measure, without purpose and regard, \nwithout mercy and justice, fertile and barren and uncertain at the same \ntime, think of indifference itself as power — how could you live according to \nthis indifference? Living — isn't that wanting specifically to be something \nother than this nature? Isn't hving assessing, preferring, being unfair, \nbeing limited, wanting to be different? And assuming your imperative \nto “live according to nature\" basically amounts to “hving according to \nlife” — well how could you not? Why make a principle out of what you \nyourselves are and must be? — But in fact, something quite different is \ngoing on: while pretending with delight to read the canon of your law in \nnature, you want the opposite, you strange actors and self-deceivers! Your \npride wants to dictate and annex your morals and ideals onto nature — yes, \nnature itself — you demand that it be nature “according to Stoa\" and \nyou want to make all existence exist in your own image alone — as a huge \netemal glorification and universahzation of Stoicism! For all your love of \ntruth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such \nhypnotic rigidity to have a fa/se, namely Stoic, view of nature, that you \ncan no longer see it any other way, — and some abysmal piece of arrogance finally gives you the madhouse hope that because you know how \nto tyrannize yourselves — Stoicism is self-tyranny —, nature lets itself be \n5 \"In came the ass / beautiful and very strong.\" According to KSA these hnes could be \nG. C. Lichtenberg's Vermischte Schriften (Miscellaneous Writings) (1867), V, p. 327. \nIO \nOn the prejudices of philosophers \ntyrannized as well: because isn't the Stoic a piece of nature? ... But this \nis an old, etemal story: what happened back then with the Stoics still \nhappens today, just as soon as a philosophy begins beheving in itself. It \nalways creates the world in its own image, it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical drive itself, the most spiritual will to power, to the \n“creation of the world,” to the causa prima.^ \nIO \nAll over Europe these days, the problem “of the real and the apparent \nworld\" gets taken up so eagerly and with such acuity — I would even say: \nshrewdness — that you really start to think and hsten; and anyone who \nhears only a *will to truth\" in the background here certainly does not have \nthe sharpest of ears. In rare and unusual cases, some sort of will to truth \nmight actually be at issue, some wild and adventurous streak of courage, \na metaphysician's ambition to hold on to a lost cause, that, in the end, \n\n\nwill still prefer a handful of “certainty” to an entire wagonload of pretty \npossibihties. There might even be puritanical fanatics of conscience who \nwould rather he dying on an assured nothing than an uncertain something. \nBut this is nihihsm, and symptomatic of a desperate soul in a state of \ndeadly exhaustion, however brave such virtuous posturing may appear. \nWith stronger, liveher thinkers, however, thinkers who still have a thirst for \nlife, things look different. By taking sides against appearance and speaking \nabout “perspective” in a newly arrogant tone, by granting their own bodies \nabout as httle credibihty as they grant the visual evidence that says “the \nearth stands still,” and so, with seemingly good spirits, rehnquishing their \nmost secure possession (since what do people believe in more securely \nthese days than their bodies?), who knows whether they are not basically \ntrying to re-appropriate something that was once possessed even more \nsecurely, something from the old estate of a bygone faith, perhaps “the \nimmortal soul\" or perhaps *the old God,\" in short, ideas that helped \nmake life a bit better, which is to say stronger and more cheerful than \n“modem ideas\" can do? There is a mistrust of these modem ideas here, \nthere 1s a disbelief in everything built yesterday and today; perhaps it is \nmixed with a bit of antipathy and contempt that can no longer stand the \nbric-a-brac of concepts from the most heterogeneous sources, which is \n6 First cause. \nII \nBeyond Good and Evil \nhow so-called positivism puts itself on the market these days, a disgust felt \nby the more discriminating taste at the fun-fair colors and fhmsy scraps of \nall these reality-philosophasters who have nothing new and genuine about \nthem except these colors. Here, I think, we should give these skeptical \nanti-reahsts and epistemo-microscopists their just due: the instinct that \ndrives them away from modem reality is unassailable, — what do we care \nfor their retrograde shortcut! The essential thing about them is not that \nthey want to go “back”: but rather, that they want to get — away. A bit \nmore strength, flight, courage, artistry: and they would want to get up and \nout, — and not go back! — \nII \nIt seems to me that people everywhere these days are at pains to divert \nattention away from the real influence Kant exerted over German philosophy, and, in particular, wisely to overlook the value he attributed to \nhimself. First and foremost, Kant was proud of his table of categories,’ \n\n\nand he said with this table in his hands: “This is the hardest thing that \never could have been undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.\" — But let us \nbe clear about this “could have been”! He was proud of having discovered \na new faculty in humans, the faculty of synthetic judgments a priori. Of \ncourse he was deceiving himself here, but the development and rapid \nblossoming of German philosophy depended on this pride, and on the \ncompetitive zeal of the younger generation who wanted, if possible, to discover something even prouder — and in any event “new faculties”! — But \nthe time has come for us to think this over. How are synthetic judgments \na priori possible? Kant asked himself, — and what really was his answer? By \nvirtue of a faculty, which is to say: enabled by an abihty? unfortunately, \nthough, not in these few words, but rather so laboriously, reverentially, \nand with such an extravagance of German frills and profundity that people failed to hear the comical niaiserie allemande? in such an answer. In \nfact, people were beside themselves with joy over this new faculty, and \nthe jubilation reached its peak when Kant discovered yet another faculty, \na moral faculty: — because the Germans were still moral back then, and \n7 The reference in this section is to Kant's Kritik der reinen Vemunft (Critique of Pu\n1787). \n8 Tn German: Vermóge eines Vermögens. \n9 German silhness. \nI2 \nOn the prejudices of philosophers \nvery remote from Realpohtik. — The honeymoon of German philosophy \nhad arrived; all the young theologians of the Tübingen seminary”? ran off \ninto the bushes — they were all looking for “faculties.” And what didn't \nthey find — in that innocent, abundant, still youthful age of the German \nspirit, when Romanticism, that mahcious fairy, whispered, whistled, and \nsang, when people did not know how to tell the difference between “discovering\" and “inventing”!\"’ Above all, a faculty of the “supersensible”: \nSchelhng christened it intellectual intuition, and thus gratified the heart's \ndesire of his basically piety-craving Germans. We can do no greater injustice to this whole high-spirited and enthusiastic movement (which was \njust youthfulness, however boldly it might have clothed itself in gray and \nhoary concepts) than to take it seriously or especially to treat it with moral \nindignation. Enough, we grew up, — the dream faded away. There came \na time when people scratched their heads: some still scratch them today. There had been dreamers: first and foremost — the old Kant. “By \nvirtue of a faculty\" — he had said, or at least meant. But 1s that really — an \nanswer? An explanation? Or instead just a repetition of the question? So \n\n\nhow does opium cause sleep? “By virtue of a faculty,” namely the virtus \ndormitiva — replies the doctor in Mohère, \nquia est in eo virtus dormitiva, \ncujus est natura sensus assoupire.? \nBut answers hke this belong in comedy, and the time has finally come \nto replace the Kantian question “How are synthetic judgments a priori \npossible?” with another question, “Why is the belief in such judgments \nnecessary?\" — to reahze, in other words, that such judgments must be \nbelieved true for the purpose of preserving beings of our type; which \nis why these judgments could of course still be false! Or, to be blunt, \nbasic and clearer still: synthetic judgments a priori do not have “to be \npossible\" at all: we have no right to them, and in our mouths they are \nnothing but false judgments. It is only the belief in their truth that 1s \nnecessary as a foreground belief and piece of visual evidence, belonging \nto the perspectival optics of life. — And, finally, to recall the enormous \neffect that “the German philosophy” — its right to these quotation marks \n1° A reference to Hegel, Hölderhn, and Schelhng. \n™ In German: “‘finden’ und ‘erfinden.’ ”? \n12 “Because there is a dormative virtue in it / whose nature is to put the senses to sl\nMohére's Le Malade imaginaire (The Hypochondriac) (1673).",
    "Faber": "You want to /ive ‘according to nature’? Oh you noble Stoics,* what \n\n\ndeceit hes in these words! Imagine a creature constituted hke nature, \nprodigal beyond measure, neutral beyond measure, with no purpose \nor conscience, with no compassion or faimess, fertile and desolate \nand uncertain all at once; imagine Indifference itself as a power: \nhow could you live according to this indifference? To live—isn’t \nthat precisely the desire to be other than this nature? Doesn’t life \nmean weighing, preferring, being unjust, having limits, wanting to \nbe Different? And even if the real meaning of your imperative \n‘to live according to nature’ is ‘to live according to life-—how could \nyou do otherwise? Why make a principle out of something that you \nalready are and needs must be? \nThe truth is something else entirely: while you pretend to delight \nin reading the canon of your law from nature, you want the opposite, \nyou curious play-actors and self-deceivers! In your pride you want \nto dictate your morality, your ideals to nature, incorporate them \ninto nature, of all things; you demand that nature be ‘according to \nStoics’; you would hke to make all existence exist in accordance with \nyour own image alone—for the great and unending glorification and \nuniversahzation of Stoicism! With all your love of truth, you force \nyourselves to stare so long, so constantly, so hypnotically at nature \nthat you see it falsely, that is, stoically, and you become incapable \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers II \nof seeing it otherwise. And then out of some unfathomable arrogance you conceive the lunatic hope that because you know how to \ntyrannize yourself (Stoicism is self-tyranny), nature too can be tyrannized: for isn’t the Stoic a part of nature? ... \nBut this is an old, etemal story: what took place back then with \nthe Stoics is still taking place today, whenever a philosophy begins \nto believe in itself. It always creates the world according to its own \nimage, it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical drive \nitself, the most spiritual form of the will to power, to ‘creation of \nthe world’, to the causa prima.* \nI0 \nThe zeal and subtlety (I would almost hke to say ‘cunning’) with \nwhich everyone in Europe today is raising the question ‘of the real \nand the apparent world’ give us cause for thought and for hstening—and anyone who hears only a ‘will to truth’ in the \nbackground certainly does not have the sharpest ears. In a few rare, \nisolated cases a will to truth really may have played a part, an \nextravagant or adventurous mood, a metaphysician’s craving for the \n\n\nlost cause, a will that ultimately prefers a handful of ‘certainty’ to \na whole wagonload of beautiful possibihties; there may even be \nsome puritanical fanatics of conscience* who would rather lay down \ntheir lives for a certain Nothing than for an uncertain Something. \nBut however vahant the gestures of such virtue, this is nihihsm, \nthe sign of a despairing, mortally weary soul. With stronger, more \nvital thinkers, still thirsty for life, things are different: they take \nsides against appearance and are already pronouncing the word \n‘perspectivist’ with arrogance; they take the credibihty of their own \nbody about as seriously as the credibihty of the appearance that \n‘the earth stands still’. They seem to be ready cheerfully to let \ndrop from their hands their surest possession (for what do we \nbelieve in more surely than our bodies?) and who knows whether \nat bottom they might not want to regain something that they once \npossessed even more surely, something from the old homestead of \nbelief of earher times, the ‘immortal soul’ perhaps, or ‘the old \ngod’—ideas, in short, that led to a life that was better, more robust \nand serene, than the one our ‘modem ideas’ can lead to? In this \nquestion, there is mistrust of modem ideas, disbelief in everything \n12 Beyond Good and Evil \nconstructed yesterday and today; there may be a slight element of \ndisgust and contempt, from those no longer able to tolerate the \nhighly eclectic conceptual bric-a-brac that today’s so-called positivism brings to the market place; those with more fastidious taste \nare revolted by the fairground motley and frippery of all these \nreality-philosophists, who have nothing new or genuine apart from \ntheir motley. We should credit the sceptical anti-reahsts and knowledge-microscopists of today with at least this much, | think: we \nhave seen nothing to refute their instinct to escape from modem \nreality—thceir retrograde backroads are no concem of ours! What \nis important about them is not that they want to go ‘back’, but that \nthey want to go-—a may! With a httle more strength, more buoyancy, \ncourage, artistry, they would want to go beyond—and not back! \nII \nPeople today are trying, it seems to me, to divert attention from \nKant’s real influence on German philosophy, trying especially to \nevade what he himself considered his great value. Kant was most \nproud of his table of categories; holding it in his hands he said, \n‘This is the most difficult thing that ever could be undertaken for \nthe benefit of metaphysics.’ \nBut let us understand what this ‘could be’ really implies! He was \n\n\nproud of having discovered in man a new faculty, the faculty to \nmake synthetic a priori judgements. Granted that he was deceiving \nhimself about his discovery: nevertheless, the development and \nrapid flowering of German philosophy stem from this pride \nand from the rivalry of his disciples to discover if at all possible \nsomething worthy of even more pride—and in any event ‘new \nfaculties”! \nBut let’s think about it, it is high time. ‘How are synthetic a \npriori judgements possible? wondered Kant, and what did he \nanswer? They are facihtated by a faculty:* unfortunately, however, \nhe did not say this in four words, but so cumbersomely, so venerably, \nand with such an expense of German profundity and omateness \nthat people misheard the comical miaiserie allemande* in such an \nanswer. They were ecstatic about this new faculty, in fact, and the \nrejoicing reached its height when Kant discovered a moral faculty \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers 13 \nin man as well. (For at that time Germans were still moral, and \nnot yet ‘real-pohtical’.*) \nThere followed the honeymoon of German philosophy; all the \nyoung theologians of the Tiibingen Stift* headed right for the \nbushes—they were all looking for ‘faculties’. And what all didn’t \nthey find, in that innocent, rich, still youthful era of the German \nspirit when the mahcious elf Romanticism was still piping and \nsinging, back when no one yet had leamed to distinguish between \n‘finding’ and ‘inventing’!* They found above all a faculty for the \n‘extra-sensual’: Schelhng christened it ‘intellectual intuition’,* thus \nmeeting the dearest desires of his essentially pious-desirous \nGermans. One can do no greater injustice to this whole arrogant, \nenthusiastic movement (which was youth itself, however audaciously \nit may have cloaked itself in grey, senile concepts) than to take it \nseriously and treat it with anything hke moral indignation. Enough, \npeople grew older—the dream vanished. The time came for them \nto rub their foreheads: they are rubbing them still today. They had \nbeen dreaming, and the first among them had been old Kant. \n‘Facihtated by a faculty’—that’s what he had said, or at least that’s \nwhat he had meant. But what kind of an answer is that? What kind \nof explanation? Isn’t it rather simply repeating the question? How \ncan opium make us sleep? It is ‘facihtated by a faculty’, the virtus \ndormitiva, answers that doctor in Mohère, \nquia est in eo virtus dormitiva \ncujus est natura sensus assoupire.* \n\n\nBut answers hke these belong in comedy, and for the Kantian \nquestion ‘How are synthetic.a priori judgements possible?’ it is \nhigh time to substitute another question: ‘Why is the belief in \nsuch judgements necessary?’—it is time to understand that for the \npurpose of preserving creatures of our kind, we must believe that \nsuch judgements are true; which means, of course, that they could \nstill be false judgements. Or to put it more clearly, and crudely and \ncompletely: synthetic a priori judgements should not ‘be possible’ \nat all; we have no right to them, in our mouths they are only false \njudgements. Yet the belief in their truth happens to be necessary \nas one of the foreground beliefs and appearances that constitute \nthe perspective-optics of life. \nAnd, finally, remembering the enormous effect that ‘German \n14 Beyond Good and Evil \nphilosophy’ exercised throughout Europe (one understands, I hope, \nwhy it deserves quotation marks?), let no one doubt that a certain \nvirtus dormitiva had a part in it: amidst the noble men of leisure, \nthe morahsts, mystics, artists, the partial Christians, and pohtical \nobscurantists of every nation, people were delighted that German \nphilosophy offered an antidote to the still overpowering sensuahsm \npouring into this century from the previous one, in short: ‘sensus \nassoupire’. ..",
