    "Gutenberg": "Die längste Zeit der menschhchen Geschichte hindurch - man nennt\nsie die prähistorische Zeit - wurde der Werth oder der Unwerth einer\nHandlung aus ihren Folgen abgeleitet: die Handlung an sich kam dabei\nebensowenig als ihre Herkunft in Betracht, sondem ungefähr so, wie\nheute noch in China eine Auszeichnung oder Schande vom Kinde auf die\nEltem zurückgreift, so war es die rückwirkende Kraft des Erfolgs oder\nMisserfolgs, welche den Menschen anleitete, gut oder schlecht von\neiner Handlung zu denken. Nennen wir diese Periode die vormorahsche\nPeriode der Menschheit: der Imperativ \"erkenne dich selbst!\" war\ndamals noch unbekannt. In den letzten zehn Jahrtausenden ist man\nhingegen auf einigen grossen Flächen der Erde Schritt für Schritt\nso weit gekommen, nicht mehr die Folgen, sondem die Herkunft der\nHandlung über ihren Werth entscheiden zu lassen: ein grosses Ereigniss\nals Ganzes, eine erhebhche Verfeinerung des Bhcks und Maassstabs,\ndie unbewusste Nachwirkung von der Herrschaft aristokratischer Werthe\nund des Glaubens an \"Herkunft\", das Abzeichen einer Periode, welche\nman im engeren Sinne als die morahsche bezeichnen darf: der erste\nVersuch zur Selbst-Erkenntniss ist damit gemacht. Statt der Folgen die\nHerkunft: welche Umkehrung der Perspektive! Und sicherhch eine erst\nnach langen Kämpfen und Schwankungen erreichte Umkehrung! Freihch:\nein verhängnissvoller neuer Aberglaube, eine eigenthümhche Engigkeit\nder Interpretation kam eben damit zur Herrschaft: man interpretirte\ndie Herkunft einer Handlung im allerbestimmtesten Sinne als Herkunft\naus einer Absicht; man wurde Eins im Glauben daran, dass der Werth\n\neiner Handlung im Werthe ihrer Absicht belegen sei. Die Absicht als\ndie ganze Herkunft und Vorgeschichte einer Handlung: unter diesem\nVorurtheile ist fast bis auf die neueste Zeit auf Erden morahsch\ngelobt, getadelt, gerichtet, auch philosophirt worden. - Sollten wir\naber heute nicht bei der Nothwendigkeit angelangt sein, uns nochmals\nüber eine Umkehrung und Grundverschiebung der Werthe schlüssig zu\nmachen, Dank einer nochmahgen Selbstbesinnung und Vertiefung des\nMenschen, - sollten wir nicht an der Schwelle einer Periode stehen,\nwelche, negativ, zunächst als die aussermorahsche zu, bezeichnen\nwäre: heute, wo wenigstens unter uns Immorahsten der Verdacht sich\nregt, dass gerade in dem, was nicht-absichthch an einer Handlung\nist, ihr entscheidender Werth belegen sei, und dass alle ihre\nAbsichthchkeit, Alles, was von ihr gesehn, gewusst, \"bewusst\" werden\nkann, noch zu ihrer Oberfläche und Haut gehöre, - welche, wie jede\nHaut, Etwas verräth, aber noch mehr verbirgt? Kurz, wir glauben, dass\ndie Absicht nur ein Zeichen und Symptom ist, das erst der Auslegung\nbedarf, dazu ein Zeichen, das zu Vielerlei und folghch für sich\nallein fast nichts bedeutet, - dass Moral, im bisherigen Sinne, also\nAbsichten-Moral ein Vorurtheil gewesen ist, eine Voreihgkeit, eine\nVorläufigkeit vielleicht, ein Ding etwa vom Range der Astrologie und\nAlchymie, aber jedenfalls Etwas, das überwunden werden muss. Die\nÜberwindung der Moral, in einem gewissen Verstande sogar die\nSelbstüberwindung der Moral: mag das der Name für jene lange\ngeheime Arbeit sein, welche den feinsten und redhchsten, auch den\nboshaftesten Gewissen von heute, als lebendigen Probirsteinen der\nSeele, vorbehalten bheb. -",

The action itself was considered as httle as its ori44 BEYOND GOOD AND BVIL \ngin. It was rather the way a distinction or disgrace still reaches back \ntoday from a child to its parents, in China: it was the retroactive \nforce of success or failure that Jed men to think well or ill of an action. Let us call this period the pre-moral period of mankind: the \nimperative “know thyself!” was as yet unknown. \nIn the last ten thousand years, however, one has reached the \npoint, step by step, in a few large regions on the earth, where it is no \nlonger the consequences but the origin of an action that one allows \nto decide its value. On the whole this is a great event which involves a considerable refinement of vision and standards; it is the \nunconscious aftereffect of the rule of aristocratic values and the \nfaith in “descent”—the sign of a period that one may call moral in \nthe narrower sense. It involves the first attempt at self-knowledge. \nInstead of the consequences, the origin: indeed a reversal of perspective! Surely, a reversal achieved only after long struggles and \nvacillations. To be sure, a calamitous new superstition, an odd \nnarrowness of interpretation, thus become dominant: the origin of \nan action was interpreted in the most definite sense as origin in an \nintention; one came to agree that the value of an action lay in the \nvalue of the intention. The intention as the whole origin and prehistory of an action—almost to the present day this prejudice dominated moral praise, blame, judgment, and philosophy on earth, \nBut today—shouldn’t we have reached the necessity of once \nmore resolving on a reversal and fundamental shift in values, owing to another self-examination of man, another growth in profundity? Don’t we stand at the threshold of a period which should \nbe designated negatively, to begin with, as extra-moral? After all, \ntoday at least we immorahsts have the suspicion that the decisive \nvalue of an action hes precisely in what is unintentional in it, while \neverything about it that is intentional, everything about it that can \nbe seen, known, “conscious,” still belongs to its surface and skin— \nwhich, hke every skin, betrays something but conceals even more. \n\n\nIn short, we believe that the intention is merely a sign and symptom that still requires interpretation—morcover, a sign that \nmeans too much and therefore, taken by itself alone, almost nothing.

    "Hollingdale": "Throughout the longest part of human history — it is called prehistoric times — the \nvalue or non-value of an action was derived from its consequences: the action itself \ncame as httle into consideration as did its origin, but, in much the same way as \ntoday in China a distinction or disgrace reflects back from the child onto its parents,\nso it was the retroactive force of success or failure which led men to think well or il\nof an action. Let us call this period the pre-moral period of mankind: the \nimperative ‘know thyself!’ was then still unknown. Over the past ten thousand years, \non the other hand, one has in a few large tracts of the earth come step by step to the \npoint at which it is no longer the consequences but the origin of the action which \ndetermines its value: a great event, taken as a whole, a considerable refinement of \nvision and standard, the unconscious after-effect of the sovereignty of aristocratic \nvalues and of belief in ‘origins’, the sign of a period which may be called the moral \n\n\nin the narrower sense: the first attempt at self-knowledge has been made. Instead of \nthe consequences, the origin: what an inversion of perspectives! And certainly one \nachieved only after protracted struggles and vacillations! To be sure, a fateful new \nsuperstition, a pecuhar narrowness of interpretation therewith became dominant: \nmen interpreted the origin of an action in the most definite sense as origin in an \nintention; men became unanimous in the belief that the value of an action resided in \nthe value of the intention behind it. The intention as the whole origin and prehistory \nof an action: it is under the sway of this prejudice that one has morally praised, \nblamed, judged and philosophized on earth almost to the present day. — But ought \nwe not today to have arrived at the necessity of once again determining upon an \ninversion and shift of values, thanks to another self-examination and deepening on \nthe part of man — ought we not to stand on the threshold of a period which should \nbe called, negatively at first, the extra-moral: today, when among us immorahsts at \nleast the suspicion has arisen that the decisive value of an action resides in precisel\nthat which is not intentional in it, and that all that in it which is intentional, all \nthat can be seen, known, ‘conscious’, still belongs to its surface and skin — which, \nhke every skin, betrays something but conceals still more? In brief, we believe that \nthe intention is only a sign and symptom that needs interpreting, and a sign, \nmoreover, that signifies too many things and which thus taken by itself signifies \npractically nothing — that morality in the sense in which it has been understood \nhitherto, that is to say the morality of intentions, has been a prejudice, a precipitancy, perhaps something provisional and precursory, perhaps something of the \norder of astronomy and alchemy, but in any event something that must be \novercome.

    "Norman": "During the longest epoch of human history (which is called the prehistoric \nage) an action's value or lack of value was derived from its consequences; \nthe action itself was taken as httle into account as its origin. Instead, \nthe situation was something hke that of present-day China, where the \nhonor or dishonor of a child reflects back on the parents. In the same \nway, it was the retroactive force of success or failure that showed people whether to think of an action as good or bad. We can call this period the pre-moral period of humanity. At that point, the imperative \n“know thyself!” was still unknown. By contrast, over the course of the last \nten millennia, people across a large part of the earth have gradually come \nfar enough to see the origin, not the consequence, as decisive for the \nvalue of an action. By and large, this was a great event, a considerable refinement of outlook and criterion, an unconscious after-effect of the \ndominance of aristocratic values and the belief in “origin,” and the sign \nof a period that we can signify as moral in a narrow sense. This marks the \nfirst attempt at self-knowledge. Origin rather than consequence: what a \nreversal of perspective! And, certainly, this reversal was only accomplished \nafter long struggles and fluctuations! Granted: this meant that a disastrous",
    "Faber": "During the longest age of human history—it is called the prehistoric age—an action’s value or lack of value was determined by its \nconsequences: the action itself was taken into consideration as httle \nas its origin. More or less as in China today, where a child’s \ndistinction or disgrace reflects back on the parent, the retroactive \nforce of the success or failure of an action determined whether \npeople thought well or badly of it. Let us call this period mankind’s \npre-moral period: at this time no one had heard of the imperative \n‘know thyself? Buring the last ten thousand years, however, over \nlarge stretches of the earth, people have httle by httle reached the \npoint of determining the value of an action not by its consequences \nbut by its origins. Taken as a whole, this was a great event, a \nconsiderable refinement in perceptions and standards, with the \n\n\nunconscious influence of the dominance of aristocratic values and \nthe belief in ‘origins’ still persisting. It was the badge of a period \nthat we may designate in the narrower sense as the mora/ period, and \nit signals the first attempt at self-knowledge. Instead of consequences, origins: what a reversal of perspective! And most certainly \na reversal achieved only after long struggles and hesitations! Along \nwith it, to be sure, came an ominous new superstition, a pecuhar \nnarrowness of interpretation took hold: the origin of an action was \ninterpreted in the most precise terms as itself originating in an \nintention; everyone was united in the belief that the value of \nan action lay in the value of its intention. Intention as the entire \nsource and past history of an action: almost right up into modem \ntimes this prejudice has determined how moral judgements have \nbeen made on earth, praising, blaming, judging, philosophizing. \nThe Free Spirit 33 \nBut now that human beings are again gaining a deeper selfawareness, shouldn’t we weigh another reversal and fundamental \nshift in values—might we not be standing at the threshold of a \nperiod that, to put it negatively, would at first have to be described \nas extra-moral? Is not the suspicion growing, at least among us \nimmorahsts, that an action’s decisive value is demonstrated precisely \nby that part of it that is not intentional, do we not suspect that all \nof an action’s intentionahty, everything that can be seen or known \nabout it, that can be ‘conscious’ about it, is still part of its surface \nand skin—which, hke all skin, reveals something, but hides even \nmore? In short, we believe that the intention is but a sign or a \nsymptom, first of all requiring interpretation, and furthermore that \nit is a sign with so many meanings that as a consequence it has \nalmost none in and of itself; we believe that morality in its earher \nsense, intention-morality, was a prejudice, something precipitous \nor perhaps prehminary, something of the order of astrology or \nalchemy, but in any event something that must be overcome. The \novercoming of morality, or even (in a certain sense) the self-overcoming of morality: let that be the name for the long, clandestine \nwork that was kept in reserve for the most subtle and honest \n(and also the most mahcious) people of conscience today, hving \ntouchstones of the human heart.—",
    "Zimmern": "Throughout the longest period of human history — one \nUs it the prehistoric period — the value or none-value of \n38 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nan action was inferred from its consequences; the action in \nitself was not taken into consideration, any more than its \norigin; but pretty much as in China at present, where the \ndistinction or disgrace of a child redounds to its parents, the \nretro-operating power of success or failure was what induced \nmen to think well or ill of an action. Let us call this period \nthe pre-moral period of mankind; the imperative, \"know \nthyself!\" was then still unknown. — In the last ten thousand \nyears, on the other hand, on certain large portions of the \nearth, one has gradually got so far, that one no longer lets \nthe consequences of an action, but its origin, decide Vv'ith \nregard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole, an important refinement of vision and of criterion, the unconscious effect of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of \nthe belief in \"origin,\" the mark of a period which may be \ndesignated in the narrower sense as the moral one: the first \nattempt at self-knowledge is thereby made. Instead of the \nconsequences, the origin — what an inversion of perspective! \nAnd assuredly an inversion effected only after long struggle \nand wavering! To be sure, an ominous new superstition, a \npecuhar narrowness of interpretation, attained supremacy \nprecisely thereby: the origin of an action was interpreted \nin the most definite sense possible, as origin out of an \n\n\nintention; people were agreed in the belief that the value of \nan action lay in the value of its intention. The intention \nas the sole origin and antecedent history of an action: under \nthe influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have \nbeen bestowed, and men have judged and even philosophised almost up to the present day. — Is it not possible, \nhowever, that the necessity may now have arisen of again \nmaking up our minds with regard to the reversing and \nfundamental shifting of values, owing to a new self-consciousness and acuteness in man — is it not possible that we \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 39 \nmay be standing on the threshold of a period which to begin with, would be distinguished negatively as ultra-moral: \nnowadays when, at least amongst us immorahsts, the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action hes precisely in that which is not intentional, and that all its intentionalness, all that is seen, sensible, or \"sensed\" in it, belongs to its surface or skin — which, hke every sldn, betrays \nsomething, but conceals still more? In short, we believe \nthat the intention is only a sign or symptom, which first \nrequires an explanation — a sign, moreover, which has too \nmany interpretations, and consequently hardly any meaning \nin itself alone: that morality, in the sense in which it has \nbeen understood hitherto, as intention-morality, has been a \nprejudice, perhaps a prematureness or prehminariness, probably something of the same rank as astrology and alchemy, \nbut in any case something which must be surmounted. \nThe surmounting of morality, in a certain sense even the \nself-mounting of morality — ^let that be the name for the \nlong secret labour which has been reserved for the most refined, the most upright, and also the most wicked consciences of to-day, as the hving touchstones of the soul."
