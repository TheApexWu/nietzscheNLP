    "Gutenberg": "Was den Aberglauben der Logiker betrifft: so will ich nicht müde\nwerden, eine kleine kurze Thatsache immer wieder zu unterstreichen,\nwelche von diesen Abergläubischen ungem zugestanden wird, - nämhch,\ndass ein Gedanke kommt, wenn \"er\" will, und nicht wenn \"ich\" will; so\ndass es eine Fälschung des Thatbestandes ist, zu sagen: das Subjekt\n\"ich\" ist die Bedingung des Prädikats \"denke\". Es denkt: aber dass\ndies \"es\" gerade jenes alte berühmte \"Ich\" sei, ist, milde geredet,\nnur eine Annahme, eine Behauptung, vor Allem keine \"unmittelbare\nGewissheit\". Zuletzt ist schon mit diesem \"es denkt\" zu viel gethan:\nschon dies \"es\" enthält eine Auslegung des Vorgangs und gehört nicht\nzum Vorgange selbst. Man schhesst hier nach der grammatischen\nGewohnheit \"Denken ist eine Thätigkeit, zu jeder Thätigkeit gehört\nEiner, der thätig ist, folghch -\". Ungefähr nach dem gleichen Schema\nsuchte die ältere Atomistik zu der \"Kraft\", die wirkt, noch jenes\nKlümpchen Materie, worin sie sitzt, aus der heraus sie wirkt, das\nAtom; strengere Köpfe lemten endhch ohne diesen \"Erdenrest\"\nauskommen, und vielleicht gewöhnt man sich eines Tages noch daran,\nauch seitens der Logiker ohne jenes kleine \"es\" (zu dem sich das\nehrhche alte Ich verflüchtigt hat) auszukommen.",
    "Kaufmann": "With regard to the superstitions of Jogicians, I shall never tire \nof emphasizing a small terse fact, which these superstitious minds \nhate to concede—namely, that a thought comes when “it” wishes, \nand not when “I” wish, so that it is a falsification of the facts of the \ncase to say that the subject “I” is the condition of the predicate \n“think.” It thinks; but that this “it” is precisely the famous old \n“ego” is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an “immediate certainty.” After all, one has even gone \ntoo far with this “it thinks”——even the “it” contains an interpretation of the process, and does not belong to the process itself. One \ninfers here according to the grammatical habit: “Thinking is an activity; every activity requires an agent; consequently” \nIt was pretty much according to the same schema that the \nolder atomism sought, besides the operating “power,” that lump \nof matter in which it residés and out of which it operates—the \natom. More rigorous minds, however, leamed at last to get along \nwithout this “earth-residuum,” and perhaps some day we shall accustom ourselves, including the logicians, to get along without the \nhttle “it” (which is all that is left of the honest httle old ego).",
    "Hollingdale": "As for the superstitions of the logicians, I shall never tire of underhning a concise \nhttle fact which these superstitious people are loath to admit — namely, that a \nthought comes when ‘it’ wants, not when ‘T want; so that it is a falsification of the \nfacts to say: the subject ‘T is the condition of the predicate ‘think’. /t thinks: but \nthis ‘it’ is precisely that famous old T is, to put it mildly, only an assumption, an \nassertion, above all not an ‘immediate certainty’. For even with this ‘it thinks’ one \nhas already gone too far: this ‘it’ already contains an interpretation of the event and\ndoes not belong to the event itself. The inference here is in accordance with the \nhabit of grammar: ‘thinking is an activity, to every activity pertains one who acts, \nconsequently —’. It was more or less in accordance with the same scheme that the \nolder atomism sought, in addition to the ‘force’ which acts, that httle lump of matter\nin which it resides, out of which it acts, the atom; more rigorous minds at last \nleamed to get along without this ‘residuum of earth’, and perhaps we and the \nlogicians as well will one day accustom ourselves to getting along without that httle \n‘it’ (which is what the honest old ‘PF has evaporated into).",
    "Norman": "As far as the superstitions of the logicians are concemed: I will not stop \nemphasizing a tiny httle fact that these superstitious men are loath to \nadmit: that a thought comes when “it” wants, and not when “I” want. \nIt is, therefore, a falsification of the facts to say that the subject “I” is \nthe condition of the predicate “think.” It thinks: but to say the “it” is \njust that famous old “Į” — well that is just an assumption or opinion, to \nput it mildly, and by no means an “immediate certainty.” In fact, there \nis already too much packed into the “it thinks”: even the “it” contains \nan interpretation of the process, and does not belong to the process itself. \nPeople are following grammatical habits here in drawing conclusions, \nreasoning that “thinking is an activity, behind every activity something is",
    "Faber": "As regards the superstition of logicians, I never tire of underhning \na quick httle fact that these superstitious people are reluctant to \nadmit: namely, that a thought comes when ‘it’ wants to, and not \nwhen ‘I’ want it to; so it is falsifying the facts to say that the subject \n\n\nT is the condition of the predicate ‘think’. There is thinking,* but \nto assert that ‘there’ is the same thing as that famous old ‘P is, to \nput it mildly, only an assumption, an hypothesis, and certainly not \nan ‘immediate certainty’. And in the end ‘there is thinking’ is also \ngoing too far: even this ‘there’ contains an interpretation of the \nprocess and is not part of the process itself. People are concluding \nhere according to grammatical habit: ‘Thinking is an activity; for \neach activity there is someone who acts; therefore—.’ Following \n18 Beyond Good and Evil \napproximately the same pattem, ancient atomism looked for that \nparticle of matter, the atom, to complement the effective ‘energy’ \nthat works from out of it; more rigorous minds finally leamed to \ndo without this ‘httle bit of carth’ and perhaps some day logicians \nwill even get used to doing without that httle ‘there’ (into which \nthe honest old ‘T has evaporated).",
    "Zimmern": "With regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never \ntire of emphasising a small, terse fact, which is unwilhngly \nrecognised by these credulous minds — namely, that a thought \ncomes when \"it\" wishes, and not when \"I\" wish; so that it \nis a perversion of the facts of the case to say that the subject \n\"I\" is the condition of the predicate \"think.\" One thinks; \nbut that this \"one\" is precisely the famous old \"ego,\" is, \nto put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an \"immediate certainty.\" After all, one has \neven gone too far with this \"one thinks\" — even the \"one\" \ncontains an interpretation of the process, and does not belong to the process itself. One infers here according to the \nusual grammatical formula — \"To think is an activity; every \nactivity requires an agency that is active; consequently\" . . . \nIt was pretty much on the same hnes that the older atomism \nsought, besides the operating \"power,\" the material particle \nwherein it resides and out of which it operates — the atom. \nMore rigourous minds, however, leamt at last to get along \nwithout this \"earth-residuum,\" and perhaps some day we \nshall accustom ourselves, even from the logician's point of \nview, to get along without the httle \"one\" (to which thdj \nworthy old \"ego\" has refined itself)."
