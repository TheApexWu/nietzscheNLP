    "Gutenberg": "Sind es neue Freunde der \"Wahrheit\", diese kommenden Philosophen?\nWahrscheinhch genug: denn alle Philosophen hebten bisher ihre\nWahrheiten. Sicherhch aber werden es keine Dogmatiker sein. Es muss\nihnen wider den Stolz gehn, auch wider den Geschmack, wenn ihre\nWahrheit gar noch eine Wahrheit für Jedermann sein soll: was bisher\nder geheime Wunsch und Hintersinn aller dogmatischen Bestrebungen war.\n\"Mein Urtheil ist mein Urtheil: dazu hat nicht leicht auch ein Anderer\ndas Recht\" - sagt vielleicht solch ein Philosoph der Zukunft. Man muss\nden schlechten Geschmack von sich abthun, mit Vielen übereinstimmen\nzu wollen. \"Gut\" ist nicht mehr gut, wenn der Nachbar es in den\nMund nimmt. Und wie könnte es gar ein \"Gemeingut\" geben! Das Wort\nwiderspricht sich selbst: was gemein sein kann, hat immer nur wenig\nWerth. Zuletzt muss es so stehn, wie es steht und immer stand: die\ngrossen Dinge bleiben für die Grossen übrig, die Abgründe für die\nTiefen, die Zartheiten und Schauder für die Feinen, und, im Ganzen und\nKurzen, alles Seltene für die Seltenen. -",
    "Kaufmann": "Are these coming philosophers new friends of “truth”? That is \n\n\nprobable enough, for all philosophers so far have loved their truths, \nBut they will certainly not be dogmatists, It must offend their pride, \nalso their taste, if their truth is supposed to be a truth for everyman \n—which has so far been the secret wish and hidden meaning of all \ndogmatic aspirations, “My judgment is my judgment”: no one else \nis easily entitled to it—that is what such a philosopher of the future \nmay perhaps say of himself. \nOne must shed the bad taste of wanting to agree with many. \n“Good” is no longer good when one’s neighbor mouths it. And \nhow should there be a “common good”! The term contradicts itself: whatever can be common always has httle value. In the end it \nmust be as it is and always has been: great things remain for the \ngreat, abysses for the profound, nuances and shudders for the refined, and, in brief, all that is rare for the rare.27—~—",
    "Hollingdale": "Are they new friends of ‘truth’, these coming philosophers? In all probability: for all\nphilosophers have hitherto loved their truths. But certainly they will not be \ndogmatists. It must offend their pride, and also their taste, if their truth is suppose\nto be a truth for everyman, which has hitherto been the secret desire and hidden \nsense of all dogmatic endeavours. ‘My judgement is my judgement: another cannot \neasily acquire a right to it — such a philosopher of the future may perhaps say. One \nhas to get rid of the bad taste of wanting to be in agreement with many. ‘Good’ is \nno longer good when your neighbour takes it into his mouth. And how could there \nexist a ‘common good’! The expression is a self-contradiction: what can be common \nhas ever but httle value. In the end it must be as it is and has always been: great \nthings are for the great, abysses for the profound, shudders and dehcacies for the \nrefined, and, in sum, all rare things for the rare. —",
    "Norman": "Are they new friends of “truth,” these upcoming philosophers? Probably, \nsince all philosophers so far have loved their truths. But they certainly \nwill not be dogmatists. It would offend their pride, as well as their taste, if \ntheir truth were a truth for everyone (which has been the secret wish and \n\n\nhidden meaning of all dogmatic aspirations so far). *My judgment is my \njudgment: other people don't have an obvious right to it too\" — perhaps \nthis is what sucha philosopher of the future will say. We must do away with \nthe bad taste of wanting to be in agreement with the majority. “Good” \nis no longer good when it comes from your neighbor's mouth. And how \ncould there ever be a “common good”! The term is self-contradictory: \nwhatever can be common will never have much value. In the end, it has to \nbe as it is and has always been: great things are left for the great, abysses \nfor the profound, dehcacy and trembhng for the subtle, and, all in all, \neverything rare for those who are rare themselves. —",
    "Faber": "Are they new friends of ‘truth’, these approaching philosophers? \nProbably so, for until now all philosophers have loved their truths. \nBut it is certain that they will not be dogmatists. It would surely \ngo against their pride, and also against their good taste, if their \n\n\ntruth had to be a truth for everyone else, too—this has been the \nsecret wish and ulterior thought in all carher dogmatic endeavours. \n‘My judgement is my judgement: no one else has a right to it so \ncasily’, as a philosopher of the future might say. We have to rid \nourselves of the bad taste of wanting to agree with many others. \n‘Good’ is no longer good if our neighbour takes the word into his \nmouth. So how could there possibly be ‘common goods’! The term \ncontradicts itself: anything that is common never has much value. \nIn the end things will have to be as they are and always have been: \nthe great things are left to the great, the abysses to the profound, \ntendemess and thrills to the sensitive, and to sum it up in a few \nwords, everything extraordinary to the extraordinary.",
    "Zimmern": "Will they be new friends of \"truth,\" these coming philoso* \nphers? Very probably, for all philosophers hitherto have \nloved their truths. But assuredly they will not be dogmatists. It must be contrary to their pride, and also conVrary to their taste, that their truth should still be truth for \nevery one — that which has hitherto been the secret wish and \nultimate purpose of all dogmatic efforts. \"My opinion is my \nopinion: another person has not easily a right to it\" — such \n\\i. philosopher of the future will say, perhaps. One must \nYenounce the bad taste of wishing to agree with many people. \"Good\" is no longer good when one's neighbour takes \nit into his mouth. And how could there be a \"common \ngood\"! The expression contradicts itself; that which can \nbe common is always of small value. In the end things \nmust be as they are and have always been — the great things \nremain for the great, the abysses for the profound, the dehcacies and thrills for the refined, and, to sum up shortly, \neverything rare for the rare."
