    "Gutenberg": "Was die materiahstische Atomistik betrifft: so gehört dieselbe zu\nden bestwiderlegten Dingen, die es giebt; und vielleicht ist heute in\nEuropa Niemand unter den Gelehrten mehr so ungelehrt, ihr ausser zum\nbequemen Hand- und Hausgebrauch (nämhch als einer Abkürzung der\nAusdrucksmittel) noch eine emsthche Bedeutung zuzumessen - Dank\nvorerst jenem Polen Boscovich, der, mitsammt dem Polen Kopemicus,\nbisher der grösste und siegreichste Gegner des Augenscheins war.\nWährend nämhch Kopemicus uns überredet hat zu glauben, wider alle\nSinne, dass die Erde nicht fest steht, lehrte Boscovich dem Glauben an\ndas Letzte, was von der Erde \"feststand\", abschwören, dem Glauben an\n\nden \"Stoff\", an die \"Materie\", an das Erdenrest- und Klümpchen-Atom:\nes war der grösste Triumph über die Sinne, der bisher auf Erden\nerrungen worden ist. - Man muss aber noch weiter gehn und auch dem\n\"atomistischen Bedürfnisse\", das immer noch ein gefährhches Nachleben\nführt, auf Gebieten, wo es Niemand ahnt, gleich jenem berühmteren\n\"metaphysischen Bedürfnisse\" - den Krieg erklären, einen\nschonungslosen Krieg auf's Messer: - man muss zunächst auch jener\nanderen und verhängnissvolleren Atomistik den Garaus machen,\nwelche das Christenthum am besten und längsten gelehrt hat, der\nSeelen-Atomistik. Mit diesem Wort sei es erlaubt, jenen Glauben\nzu bezeichnen, der die Seele als etwas Unvertilgbares, Ewiges,\nUntheilbares, als eine Monade, als ein Atomon nimmt: diesen Glauben\nsoll man aus der Wissenschaft hinausschaffen! Es ist, unter uns\ngesagt, ganz und gar nicht nöthig, \"die Seele\" selbst dabei los zu\nwerden und auf eine der ältesten und ehrwürdigsten Hypothesen Verzicht\nzu leisten: wie es dem Ungeschick der Naturahsten zu begegnen pflegt,\nwelche, kaum dass sie an \"die Seele\" rühren, sie auch verheren. Aber\nder Weg zu neuen Fassungen und Verfeinerungen der Seelen-Hypothese\nsteht offen: und Begriffe wie \"sterbhche Seele\" und \"Seele als\nSubjekts-Vielheit\" und \"Seele als Gesellschaftsbau der Triebe und\nAffekte\" wollen fürderhin in der Wissenschaft Bürgerrecht haben. Indem\nder neue Psycholog dem Aberglauben ein Ende bereitet, der bisher um\ndie Seelen-Vorstellung mit einer fast tropischen Üppigkeit wucherte,\nhat er sich freihch selbst gleichsam in eine neue Öde und ein\nneues Misstrauen hinaus gestossen - es mag sein, dass die älteren\nPsychologen es bequemer und lustiger hatten -: zuletzt aber weiss\ner sich eben damit auch zum Erfinden verurtheilt - und, wer weiss?\nvielleicht zum Finden. -",
    "Kaufmann": "As for materiahstic atomism, it is one of the best refuted \ntheories there are, and in Europe perhaps no one in the leamed \nworld is now so unscholarly as to attach serious significance to it, \n\n\nexcept for convenient household use (as an abbreviation of the \nmeans of expression)—thanks chiefly to the Dalmatian Boscovich; \nhe and the Pole Corpemicus have been the greatest and most successful opponents of visual evidence so far, For while Copemicus \n15 “Because it contains a sleepy faculty whose nature it is to put the senses \nto sleep,” \n20 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nhas persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth \ndoes not stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in \nthe last part of the earth that “stood fast”—the belief in “subStance,” in “matter,” in the earth-residuum and particle-atom:!® it is \nthe greatest triumph over the senses that has been gained on earth \nso far. \nOne must, however, go still further, and also declare war, reJentless war unto death, against the “atomistic need” which still \nleads a dangerous afterlife in places where no one suspects it, just \nhke the more celebrated “metaphysical need”: one must also, first \nof all, give the finishing stroke to that other and more calamitous \natomism which Christianity has taught best and longest, the soul \natomism. Let it be permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the soul as something indestructible, etemal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science! Between ourselves, it is not at all necessary to \nget rid of “the soul” at the same time, and thus to renounce one of \nthe most ancient and venerable hypotheses—as happens frequently to clumsy naturahsts who can hardly touch on “the soul” \nwithout immediately Josing it. But the way is open for new versions and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and such conceptions \nas “mortal soul,” and “soul as subjective multiphcity,” and “soul as \nsocial structure of the drives and affects,” 17 want henceforth to \n16 “Boscovich, an eighteenth-century Jesuit philosopher somewhat out of \nthe main stream of science . . . had defined atoms only as centers of force, \nand not as particles of matter in which powers somehow inhere” (Charles \nCoulston Gilhspie, The Edge of Objectivity: An Essay in the History of \nScientific Ideas, Princeton, N.J., Princeton University Press, 1960, p. 455). \n17 Affekt: I have rendered this term consistently as “affect”: good dictionaries include the relevant meanings. “Feehng” comes close to Nietzsche’s \nmeaning but fails to suggest the fact that the term is somewhat technical \nand carries overtones of Spinoza's affectus and a long philosophical tradition. \nMoreover, “feehng” is needed to render Gefühl, which occurs several times \nin this section. \n\n\nIn his discussion of Spinoza's affectus, Stuart Hampshire uses “affection” and places the word in quotation marks (Spinoza, Baltimore, Penguin Books, 1951, pp. 135f.). In James Mark Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, vol. 1 (1901), “affect” is defined as “A stimulus \nor motive to action which is AFFECTIVE (q.v.) or felt, not presented as \nan end,” a usage “suggested by Baldwin,” while “affection” is suggested as \nON THE PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS 21 \nhave citizens’ rights in science. When the new psychologist puts an \nend to the superstitions which have so far flourished with almost \ntropical luxuriance around the idea of the soul, he practically exiles \nhimself into a new desert and a new suspicion—it is possible that \nthe older psychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of \nit; eventually, however, he finds that precisely thereby he also \ncondemns himself to invention—and—who knows?-—perhaps to \ndiscovery.",
    "Hollingdale": "As for materiahstic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted things there are; and \nperhaps no scholar in Europe is still so unscholarly today as to accord it serious \nsignificance except for handy everyday use (as an abbreviated means of expression) \n— thanks above all to the Pole Boscovich who, together with the Pole Copemicus, \nhas been the greatest and most triumphant opponent of ocular evidence hitherto. \nFor while Copemicus persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the \nearth does not stand firm, Boscovich taught us to abjure belief in the last thing of \nearth that ‘stood firm’, belief in ‘substance’, in ‘matter’, in the earth-residuum and \nparticle atom: it was the greatest triumph over the senses hitherto achieved on earth. \n— One must, however, go still further and also declare war, a remorseless war of the \nknife, on the ‘atomistic need’ which, hke that more famous ‘metaphysical need’, still \ngoes on hving a dangerous after-life in regions where no one suspects it — one must \nalso first of all finish off that other and more fateful atomism which Christianity has\ntaught best and longest, the soul atomism. Let this expression be allowed to \ndesignate that belief which regards the soul as being something indestructible, \netemal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief ought to be ejected from \nscience! Between ourselves, it is not at all necessary by that same act to get rid of \n‘the soul’ itself and thus forgo one of the oldest and most venerable of hypotheses: \nas is often the way with clumsy naturahsts, who can hardly touch ‘the soul’ without \nlosing it. But the road to new forms and refinements of the soul-hypothesis stands \nopen: and such conceptions as ‘mortal soul’ and ‘soul as multiphcity of the subject’ \nand ‘soul as social structure of the drives and emotions’ want henceforth to possess \ncivic rights in science. To be sure, when the new psychologist puts an end to the \nsuperstition which has hitherto flourished around the soul-idea with almost tropical \nluxuriance, he has as it were thrust himself out into a new wildemess and a new \n\n\nmistrust — it may be that the older psychologists had a merrier and more \ncomfortable time of it — : ultimately, however, he sees that, by precisely that act, he\nhas also condemned himself to inventing the new — and, who knows? perhaps to \nfinding it. —",

    "Faber": "As regards materiahstic atomism,* hardly anything has ever been \nso well refuted; in all Europe there is probably no scholar so \nunschooled as to want to credit it with serious meaning, apart from \na handy everyday usefulness (that is, as a styhstic abbreviation). \nThis we owe primarily to the Pole Boscovich,* who along with the \nPole Copemicus* achieved the greatest victory yet in opposing \nthe appearance of things. For while Copemicus convinced us to \nbelieve contrary to all our senses that the earth does not stand still, \nBoscovich taught us to renounce the last thing that ‘still stood’ \nabout the earth, the belief in ‘substance’, in ‘matter’, in the bit of \nearth, the particle, the atom: no one on earth has ever won a greater \ntriumph over the senses. \nHowever, we must go even further and declare war, a merciless \nwar unto the death against the ‘atomistic need’ that continues to \nlive a dangerous afterlife in places where no one suspects it (as \ndoes the more famous ‘metaphysical need’).* The first step must \n\n\nbe to kill off that other and more ominous atomism that Christianity \ntaught best and longest: the atomism of the soul. If you allow me, I \nwould use this phrase to describe the belief that holds the soul to \nbe something ineradicable, etemal, indivisible, a monad, an atom: \nscience must cast out this belief! And confidentially, we do not need \nto get rid of ‘the soul’ itself nor do without one of our oldest, most \nvenerable hypotheses, which the bunghng naturahsts tend to do, \nlosing ‘the soul’ as soon as they’ve touched on it. But the way is \nclear for new and refined versions of the hypothesis about the soul; \nin future, concepts such as the ‘mortal soul’ and the ‘soul as the \nmultiphcity of the subject’ and the ‘soul as the social construct of \ndrives and emotions’ will claim their rightful place in science. By \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers 15 \nputting an end to the superstitions that proliferated with nearly \ntropical abundance around the idea of the soul, the new psychologist \nhas of course seemed to cast himself into a new desolation and a \nnew distrust—it may be that the old psychologists had it easier, \nmerrier—but he knows that he is thereby also condemned to \ninventing, and—who knows?—perhaps to finding—",
