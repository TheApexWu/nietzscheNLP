    "Gutenberg": "In jeder Philosophie giebt es einen Punkt, wo die \"Überzeugung\" des\nPhilosophen auf die Bühne tritt: oder, um es in der Sprache eines\nalten Mysteriums zu sagen:\n adventavit asinus\n pulcher et fortissimus.",
    "Kaufmann": "There is a point in every philosophy when the philosopher’s \n“conviction” appears on the stage—or to use the language of an \nancient Mystery: \nAdventavit asinus, \nPulcher et fortissimus. 2",
    "Hollingdale": "In every philosophy there is a point at which the philosopher's ‘conviction’ appears \non the scene: or, to put it in the words of an ancient Mystery: \nadventavit asinus, \npulcher et fortissimus.",
    "Norman": "philosophy, but rather that another drive, here as elsewhere, used knowledge (and mis-knowledge!) merely as a tool. But anyone who looks at \npeople's basic drives, to see how far they may have played their httle game \nright here as inspiring geniuses (or daemons or sprites —), will find that \nthey all practiced philosophy at some point, — and that every single one \nof them would be only too pleased to present ttself as the ultimate purpose of existence and as rightful master of all the other drives. Because \nevery drive craves mastery, and this leads it to try philosophizing. — Of \ncourse: with scholars, the truly scientific people, things might be different — “better” if you will —, with them, there might really be something \nhkea drive for knowledge, some independent httle clockwork mechanism \nthat, once well wound, ticks bravely away without essentially involving the \nrest of the scholar’s drives. For this reason, the scholar's real “interests” \nusually he somewhere else entirely, with the family, or eaming money, \nor in pohtics; in fact, it is almost a matter of indifference whether his \nhttle engine is put to work in this or that field of research, and whether \nthe “promising” young worker tums himself into a good philologist or \n\n\nfungus expert or chemist: — it doesn’t signify anything about him that he \nbecomes one thing or the other. In contrast, there is absolutely nothing \nimpersonal about the philosopher; and in particular his morals bear decided and decisive witness to who he is — which means, in what order of \nrank the innermost drives of his nature stand with respect to each other.",
    "Faber": "In every philosophy there is a point when the philosopher’s ‘conviction’ makes its entrance; or, in the language of an old mystery play: \nadventavit asinus \npulcher et fortissimus.*",
    "Zimmern": "There is a point in every philosophy at which the \"conviction\" of the philosopher appear^ on the scene; or, to put it \nin the words of an ancient mystery: \nAdventavit asinus, \nPulcher et fortissimus. \nYou desire to live \"according to Nature\"? Oh, you noble \nStoics, what fraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being \nhke Nature, boundlessly extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, \nwithout purpose or consideration, without pity or justice, at \nonce fruitful and barren and imcertam: imagine to yourselves indifference as a power — ^how could you live in accordance with such indifference? To live— is not that just \nendeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature? Is not \nhving valuing, preferring, being imjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different? And granted that your imperative, \"hving according to Nature,\" means actually the same \nas \"hving according to life\" — ^how could you do differently? \nWhy should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite \notherwise with you: while you pretend to read with rapture \nthe canon of your law in Nature, you want something quite \nthe contrary, you extraordinary stage-players and self-deluders! In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and \nideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate thei \n\n\ntherein; you insist that it shall be Nature \"according to thi \nStoa,\" and would hke everything to be made after your o \nina \nI \nenL, \nf. \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 9 \nimage, as a vast, etemal glorification and generahsm of Stoicism ! With all your love for truth, you have forced yourselves \nso long, so persistently, and with such hypnotic rigidity to \nsee Nature falsely, that is to say. Stoically, that you are no \nlonger able to see it otherwise — and to crown all, some unfathomable supercihousness gives you the Bedlamite hope \nthat because you are able to tyrannise over yourselves — \nStoicism is self-tyranny — Nature will also allow herself to be \nt)n'annised over: is not the Stoic a />cr^ of Nature? , . . But \nthis is an old and everlasting story: what happened in old \ntimes with the Stoics still happens to-day, £is soon as ever \na philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates \nthe world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual \nWill to Power, the will to \"creation of the world,\" the will \nto the causa prima."
