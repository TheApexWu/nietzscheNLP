    "Gutenberg": "Dass die einzelnen philosophischen Begriffe nichts Behebiges, nichts\nFür-sich-Wachsendes sind, sondem in Beziehung und Verwandtschaft zu\neinander emporwachsen, dass sie, so plötzhch und willkürhch sie auch\nin der Geschichte des Denkens anscheinend heraustreten, doch eben so\ngut einem Systeme angehören als die sämmthchen Gheder der Fauna\neines Erdtheils: das verräth sich zuletzt noch darin, wie sicher die\nverschiedensten Philosophen ein gewisses Grundschema von möghchen\nPhilosophien immer wieder ausfüllen. Unter einem unsichtbaren Banne\nlaufen sie immer von Neuem noch einmal die selbe Kreisbahn: sie\nmögen sich noch so unabhängig von einander mit ihrem kritischen oder\nsystematischen Willen fühlen: irgend Etwas in ihnen führt sie, irgend\nEtwas treibt sie in bestimmter Ordnung hinter einander her, eben jene\neingebome Systematik und Verwandtschaft der Begriffe. Ihr Denken\nist in der That viel weniger ein Entdecken, als ein Wiedererkennen,\nWiedererinnem, eine Rück- und Heimkehr in einen femen uralten\nGesammt-Haushalt der Seele, aus dem jene Begriffe einstmals\nherausgewachsen sind: - Philosophiren ist insofem eine Art von\nAtavismus höchsten Ranges. Die wunderhche Famihen-Ahnhchkeit alles\nindischen, griechischen, deutschen Philosophirens erklärt sich einfach\ngenug. Gerade, wo Sprach-Verwandtschaft vorhegt, ist es gar nicht\nzu vermeiden, dass, Dank der gemeinsamen Philosophie der Grammatikich meine Dank der unbewussten Herrschaft und Führung durch gleiche\ngrammatische Funktionen - von vomherein Alles für eine gleichartige\nEntwicklung und Reihenfolge der philosophischen Systeme vorbereitet\nhegt: ebenso wie zu gewissen andem Möghchkeiten der Welt-Ausdeutung\n\nder Weg wie abgesperrt erscheint. Philosophen des ural-altaischen\nSprachbereichs (in dem der Subjekt-Begriff am schlechtesten entwickelt\nist) werden mit grosser Wahrscheinhchkeit anders \"in die Welt\"\nbhcken und auf andem Pfaden zu finden sein, als Indogermanen\noder Muselmänner: der Bann bestimmter grammatischer Funktionen\nist im letzten Grunde der Bann physiologischer Werthurtheile\nund Rasse-Bedingungen. - So viel zur Zurückweisung von Locke's\nOberflächhchkeit in Bezug auf die Herkunft der Ideen.",
    "Kaufmann": "That individual philosophical concepts are not anything capricious or autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and \nrelationship with each other; that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to a system as all the members of the \nfauna of a continent—is betrayed in the end also by the fact that \nthe most diverse philosophers keep filhng in a definite fundamental scheme of possible philosophies. Under an invisible spell, \nthey always revolve once more in the same orbit; however independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical \nor systematic wills, something within them leads them, something \nimpels them in a definite order, one after the other—to wit, the innate systematic structure and relationship of their concepts. Their \nthinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a recognition, a remembering, a retum and a homecoming to a remote, primordial, and \ninclusive household of the soul, out of which those concepts grew \noriginally: philosophizing is to this extent a kind of atavism of the \nhighest order. \nThe strange family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and \nGerman philosophizing is explained easily enough. Where there is \naffinity of languages, it cannot fail, owing to the common philosophy of grammar—I mean, owing to the unconscious domination \nand guidance by similar grammatical functions—that everything is \nprepared at the outset for a similar development and sequence of \nphilosophical systems; just as the way seems barred against certain \nother possibihties of world-interpretation, It is highly probable that \nphilosophers within the domain of the Ural-Altaic languages \n28 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \n(where the concept of the subject is least developed) look otherwise “into the world,” and will be found on paths of thought different from those of the Indo-Germanic peoples and the Mustims: \nthe spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately also the \nspell of physiological valuations and racial conditions. \nSo much by way of rejecting Locke's superficiahty regarding \nthe origin of ideas,",
    "Hollingdale": "That individual philosophical concepts are not something arbitrary, something \ngrowing up autonomously, but on the contrary grow up connected and related to \none another; that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they appear to emerge in the \nhistory of thought, they none the less belong just as much to a system as do the \nmembers of the fauna of a continent: that fact is in the end also shown in the fact \nthat the most diverse philosophers unfaihngly fill out again and again a certain basic\n\n\nscheme of possible philosophies. Under an invisible spell they always trace once \nmore the identical orbit: however independent of one another they may feel, with \ntheir will to criticism or systematism, something in them leads them, something \ndrives them in a definite order one after another: it is precisely that innate \nsystematism and relationship of concepts. Their thinking is in fact not so much a \ndiscovering as a recognizing, a remembering, a retum and home-coming to a faroff, primordial total household of the soul out of which those concepts once \nemerged — philosophizing is to that extent a species of atavism of the first rank. The \nsingular family resemblance between all Indian, Greek and German philosophizing \nis easy enough to explain. Where there exists a language affinity it is quite \nimpossible, thanks to the common philosophy of grammar — I mean thanks to \nunconscious domination and directing by similar grammatical functions — to avoid \neverything being prepared in advance for a similar evolution and succession of \nphilosophical systems: just as the road seems to be barred to certain other \npossibihties of world interpretation. Philosophers within the domain of the UralAltaic languages (in which the concept of the subject is least developed) will in all \nprobability look ‘into the world’ differently and be found on different paths from the \nIndo-Germans and Moslems: the spell of definite grammatical functions is in the \nlast resort the spell of physiological value judgements and racial conditions. — So \nmuch by way of retort to Locke's superficiahty with regard to the origin of ideas.",
    "Norman": "That individual philosophical concepts are not arbitrary and do not grow \nup on their own, but rather grow in reference and relation to each other; \nthat however suddenly and randomly they seem to emerge in the history \nof thought, they still belong to a system just as much as all the members \n\n\nof the fauna of a continent do: this is ultimately revealed by the certainty \nwith which the most diverse philosophers will always fill out a definite \nbasic scheme of possible philosophies. Under an invisible spell, they will \neach start out anew, only to end up revolving in the same orbit once again. \nHowever independent of each other they might feel themselves to be, with \ntheir critical or systematic wills, something inside of them drives them \non, something leads them into a particular order, one after the other, and \nthis something is precisely the innate systematicity and relationship of \nconcepts. In fact, their thinking is not nearly as much a discovery as it is \na recognition, remembrance, a retuming and homecoming into a distant, \nprimordial, total economy of the soul, from which each concept once \ngrew: — to this extent, philosophizing is a type of atavism of the highest \norder. The strange family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and German \nphilosophizing speaks for itself clearly enough. Where there are linguistic \naffinities, then because of the common philosophy of grammar (I mean: \ndue to the unconscious domination and direction through similar grammatical functions), it is obvious that everything hes ready from the very \nstart for a similar development and sequence of philosophical systems; \non the other hand, the way seems as good as blocked for certain other \npossibihties of interpreting the world. Philosophers of the Ural-Altaic \nlanguage group (where the concept of the subject is the most poorly developed) are more hkely to “see the world” differently, and to be found on \npaths different from those taken by the Indo-Germans or Mushms: the \nspell of particular grammatical functions is in the last analysis the spell of",
    "Faber": "That individual philosophical concepts are not something isolated, \nsomething unto themselves, but rather grow up in reference and \nrelatedness to one another; that however suddenly and arbitrarily \nthey seem to emerge in the history of thought, they are as much a \npart of one system as are the branches of fauna on one continent: \nthis is revealed not least by the way the most disparate philosophers \ninvariably fill out one particular basic schema of possible philosophies. Under some unseen spell they always run around the same \norbit: however independent they may feel, one from the other, with \ntheir will to criticism or to system, something in them is leading \nthem, driving them all to follow one another in a certain order— \nan inbom taxonomy and affinity of concepts. In truth their thinking \nis much less an act of discovery than an act of recognizing anew, \nremembering anew, a retum back home to a distant, ancient universal economy of the soul from out of which those concepts \ninitially grew: philosophizing is thus a kind of atavism of the highest \norder. This easily explains the strange family resemblance of all \nIndian, Greek, and German philosophizing. Wherever linguistic \naffinity, above all, is present, everything necessary for an analogous \ndevelopment and sequence of philosophical systems will inevitably \nbe on hand from the beginning, thanks to the shared philosophy \nof grammar (I mean thanks to being unconsciously ruled and \nguided by similar grammatical functions), just as the way to certain \nother possibihties for interpreting the world will seem to be blocked. \nPhilosophers from the Ural-Altaic linguistic zone (where the \nconcept of the subject is least developed) will most probably look \ndifferently ‘into the world’ and will be found on other paths than \nIndo-Germans or Mushms: and in the last analysis, the spell of \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers 21 \n\n\ncertain grammatical functions is the spell of physiological value \njudgements and conditions of race. \nThis by way of a rejection of Locke’s superficiahty* conceming \nthe origin of ideas. \n2I \nThe causa sui* is the best intemal contradiction ever devised, a \nkind of logical freak or outrage: but because of man’s excessive \npride we have come to be deeply and terribly entangled with this \nparticular nonsense. The yeaming for ‘freedom of the will’ in the \nsuperlative metaphysical sense that unfortunately still prevails in \nthe minds of the half-educated, the yeaming to bear complete and \nfinal responsibility for one’s own actions and to relieve God, the \nworld, one’s ancestors, coincidence, society from it—this is really \nnothing less than being that same causa sui and, with a daring \ngreater than Miinchhausen’s,* dragging yourself by your hair out \nof the swamp of nothingness and into existence. Now, if someone \ncan see through the cloddish simplicity of this famous concept ‘free \nwill’ and ehminate it from his mind, I would then ask him to take \nhis ‘enlightenment’ a step further and hkewise ehminate from his \nhead the opposite of the non-concept ‘free will’: I mean the ‘unfree \nwil? which amounts to a misuse of cause and effect. One should \nnot make the mistake of concretizing ‘cause’ and ‘effect’? as do \nthe natural scientists (and whoever else today naturahzes in their \nthinking . . .), in conformity with the prevalent mechanistic foolishness that pushes and tugs at the cause until it ‘has an effect’; ‘cause’ \nand ‘effect’ should be used only as pure concepts, as conventional \nfictions for the purpose of description or communication, and \nnot for explanation. In the ‘in itself’ there is nothing of ‘causal \nassociations’, of ‘necessity’, of ‘psychological constraint’; the effect \ndoes not follow ‘upon the cause’, no ‘law’ govems it. We alone are \nthe ones who have invented causes, succession, reciprocity, relativity, coercion, number, law, freedom, reason, purpose; and if we \nproject, if we mix this world of signs into things as if it were an \n‘in itself’, we act once more as we have always done, that is, \nmythologically. The ‘unfree will’ is mythology: in real life it is only \na matter of strong and weak wills. \nWhenever a thinker sniffs out coercion, necessity, obhgation, \n22 Beyond Good and Evil \npressure, constraint in any ‘causal connection’ or ‘psychological \nnecessity’, it is almost always a symptom of where his own inadequacy hes: to feel this particular way is reveahng—the person is \nreveahng himself. And if I have observed correctly, the ‘constraint \nof the will is always conceived as a problem from two completely \nOpposite standpoints, but always in a profoundly personal way: the \none group will not hear of rehnquishing their ‘responsibility’, their \nbelief in themselves, their personal right to take ‘heir credit (the vain \nraces are of this type); conversely, the other group wants to be \nresponsible for nothing, guilty of nothing, and out of their inner \nself-contempt they yeam to cast off their own selves one way or \nanother. When this latter group writes books nowadays, they tend \nto take up the cause of criminals; a sort of sociahstic compassion \nis their nicest disguise. And indeed, it is surprising how much \nprettier the fatahsm of the weak-willed can look when it presents \nitself as ‘la religion de la souffrance humaine’;* that is what zt \nmeans by ‘good taste’.",
    "Zimmern": "That the separate philosophical ideas are not anything \noptional or autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection \nand relationship with each other; that, however suddenly \nand arbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought, \n\n\nthey nevertheless belong just as much to a system as the \ncollective members of the fauna of a Continent — is betrayed \nin the end by the circumstance: how unfaihngly the most \ndiverse philosophers always fill in again a definite funda2 2 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nmental scheme of possible philosophies. Under an invisible \nspell, they always revolve once more in the same orbit; \nhowever independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something within \nthem leads them, something impels them in definite order the \none after the other — to wit, the innate methodology and relationship of their ideas. Their thinking is, in fact, far less \na discovery than a re-recognising, a remembering, a retum \nand a home-coming to a far-off, ancient common-household \nof the soul, out of which those ideas formerly grew: philosophising is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order. The \nwonderful family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and \nGerman philosophising is easily enough explained. In fact, \nwhere there is affinity of language, owing to the common \nphilosophy of grammar — I mean owing to the unconscious \ndomination and guidance of similar grammatical functions — \nit cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outset \nfor a similar development and succession of philosophical \nsystems; just as the way seems barred against certain other \npossibihties of world-interpretation. It is highly probable \nthat philosophers within the domain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the conception of the subject is least developed) look otherwise \"into the world,\" and will be found \non paths of thought different from those of the Indo Germans and Mussulmans, the spell of certain grammatical \nfunctious is ultimately also the spell of physiological valuations and racial conditions. — So much by way of rejecting \nLocke's superficiahty with regard to the origin of ideas. \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 33"
