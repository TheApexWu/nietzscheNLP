    "Gutenberg": "Es ist die Sache der Wenigsten, unabhängig zu sein: - es ist ein\nVorrecht der Starken. Und wer es versucht, auch mit dem besten Rechte\ndazu, aber ohne es zu müssen, beweist damit, dass er wahrscheinhch\nnicht nur stark, sondem bis zur Ausgelassenheit verwegen ist. Er\nbegiebt sich in ein Labyrinth, er vertausendfältigt die Gefahren,\nwelche das Leben an sich schon mit sich bringt; von denen es nicht die\nkleinste ist, dass Keiner mit Augen sieht, wie und wo er sich verirrt,\nvereinsamt und stückweise von irgend einem Höhlen-Minotaurus des\nGewissens zerrissen wird. Gesetzt, ein Solcher geht zu Grunde, so\ngeschieht es so feme vom Verständniss der Menschen, dass sie es nicht\nfühlen und mitfühlen: - und er kann nicht mehr zurück! er kann auch\nzum Mitleiden der Menschen nicht mehr zurück! - -",
    "Kaufmann": "Independence is for the very few; it is a privilege of the \nstrong. And whoever attempts it even with the best right but without inner constraint proves that he is probably not only strong, but \nalso daring to the point of recklessness, He enters into a labyrinth, \nhe multiphes a thousandfold the dangers which life brings with it \nin any case, not the least of which is that no one can see how and \nwhere he loses his way, becomes lonely, and is tom piecemeal by \n32 In the original edition and in the standard editions; Macchiavelh, \n18 Extremely brisk and lively manner. \nH Small fact, \n42 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nsome minotaur of conscience. Supposing one hke that comes to \ngtief, this happens so far from the comprehension of men that they \nneither feel it nor sympathize. And he cannot go back any longer. \nNor can he go back to the pity of men.—",
    "Hollingdale": "Few are made for independence - it is a privilege of the strong. And he who \nattempts it, having the completest right to it but without being compelled to, thereby \nproves that he is probably not only strong but also daring to the point of \nrecklessness. He ventures into a labyrinth, he multiphes by a thousand the dangers \nwhich life as such already brings with it, not the smallest of which is that no one can\nbehold how and where he goes astray, is cut off from others, and is tom to pieces \nhmb from hmb by some cave-minotaur of conscience. If such a one is destroyed, it \ntakes place so far from the understanding of men that they neither feel it nor \nsympathize — and he can no longer go back! He can no longer go back even to the \npity of men! —",
    "Norman": "a mahcious, artistic sense for the contrast he is risking: thoughts that are \nlong, hard, tough, and dangerous, and a galloping tempo and the very \nbest and most mischievous mood. Who, finally, would dare to translate \nPetronius into German, a man who, more than any great musician so far, \nwas the master of the presto in inventions, ideas, and words. What do all the \nswamps of the sick and wicked world — even the “ancient world\" — matter \nin the end for someone hke him, with feet of wind, with the breath and \n\n\nthe force and the hberating scom ofa wind that makes everything healthy \nby making everything run! And as for Aristophanes, that transfiguring, \ncomplementary spirit for whose sake we can forgive the whole Greek world \nfor existing (as long as we have reahzed in full depth and profundity what \nneeds to be forgiven and transfigured here): — nothing I know has given \nme a better vision of Plato’s secrecy and Sphinx nature than that happily \npreserved petit fait? under the pillow of his deathbed they did not find \na “Bible” or anything Egyptian, Pythagorean, or Platonic — but instead, \nAristophanes. How would even a Plato have endured life — a Greek life \nthat he said No to — without an Aristophanes! —",
    "Faber": "Only a very few people can be independent: it is a prerogative of \nthe strong. And when independence is attempted by someone who \nhas the right to it, but does not need it, we have proof that this man \nis probably not only strong, but bold to the point of recklessness. He \nventures into a labyrinth, he multiphes life’s inevitable dangers a \n\n\nthousandfold, and not the least among these is the absence of any \nperson to see how and where he is going astray, becoming isolated, \nbeing rent apart piece by piece in the cave of some Minotaur of \nthe conscience. Assuming that such a person perishes, he perishes \nso far away from the understanding of human beings that they do \nnot feel it or feel for him—and he cannot go back again! Not even \nto the pity of humans!",
    "Zimmern": "It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a \nprivilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it, even with \nthe best right, but without being obhged to do so, proves \nthat he is probably not only strong, but also daring beyond \nmeasure. He enters into a labyrinth, he multiphes a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already brings with \nit; not the least of which is that no one can see how and \nwhere he loses his way, becomes isolated, and is tom piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing such a \none comes to grief, it is so far from the comprehension of \nmen that they neither feel it, nor sjonpathise with it. And \nhe cannot any longer go back! He cannot even go back \n[again to the sympathy of men!"
