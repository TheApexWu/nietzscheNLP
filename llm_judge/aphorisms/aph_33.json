    "Gutenberg": "Es hilft nichts: man muss die Gefühle der Hingebung, der Aufopferung\nfür den Nächsten, die ganze Selbstentäusserungs-Moral erbarmungslos\nzur Rede stellen und vor Gericht führen: ebenso wie die Ästhetik der\n\"interesselosen Anschauung\", unter welcher sich die Entmännhchung der\nKunst verführerisch genug heute ein gutes Gewissen zu schaffen sucht.\nEs ist viel zu viel Zauber und Zucker in jenen Gefühlen des \"für\nAndere\", des \"nicht für mich\", als dass man nicht nöthig hätte,\nhier doppelt misstrauisch zu werden und zu fragen: \"sind es nicht\nvielleicht - Verführungen?\" - Dass sie gefallen - Dem, der sie hat,\nund Dem, der ihre Früchte geniesst, auch dem blossen Zuschauer,dies giebt noch kein Argument für sie ab, sondem fordert gerade zur\nVorsicht auf. Seien wir also vorsichtig!",
    "Kaufmann": "There fs no other way: the feehngs of devotion, self-sacrifice \nfor one’s neighbor, the whole morality of self-denial must be questioned mercilessly and taken to court—no less than the aesthetics \nof “contemplation devoid of all interest” which is used today as a \nseductive guise for the emasculation of art, to give it a good conscience. There is too much charm and sugar in these feehngs of “for \nothers,” “not for myself,” for us not to need to become doubly suspicious at this point and to ask: “are these not perhaps—seductions?” \nThat they please—those who have them and those who enjoy their fruits, and also the mere spectator—this does not yet constitute an argument in their favor but rather invites caution, So let \nus be cautious.",
    "Hollingdale": "There is nothing for it: the feehngs of devotion, self-sacrifice for one's neighbour, \nthe entire morality of self-renunciation must be taken mercilessly to task and \nbrought to court: hkewise the aesthetics of ‘disinterested contemplation’ through \nwhich the emasculation of art today tries, seductively enough, to give itself a good \nconscience. There is much too much sugar and sorcery in those feehngs of ‘for \nothers’, of ‘not for me’, for one not to have to become doubly distrustful here and to \nask: ‘are they not perhaps — seductions?’ That they give pleasure — to him who has \nthem and to him who enjoys their fruits, also to the mere spectator — does not yet \nfumish an argument in their favour, but urges us rather to caution. So let us be \ncautious!",
    "Norman": "There is nothing else to be done: the feehngs of utter devotion, of sacrifice \nfor your neighbor, and the entire morality of self-abnegation have to \nbe mercilessly taken to court and made to account for themselves. And \nthe same holds for the aesthetic of “disinterested contemplation,” the \nseductive guise under which the castration of art is presently trying to \ncreate a good conscience for itself. These feehngs of “for others,” of \n“not for myself,” contain far too much sugar and sorcery for us not to \nneed to become doubly suspicious here and ask: “Aren’t these perhaps — \nseductions?” To say that these feehngs are pleasing (for the one who has",
    "Faber": "There’s no help for it: we must haul into court and mercilessly \ninterrogate our feehngs of devotion, of sacrifice for our neighbour, \nthe whole morality of self-renunciation, as well as the aesthetic of \n‘disinterested contemplation’,* which the current emasculation \n\n\nof art is trying to use (seductively enough) to clear its conscience. \n‘For the sake of others’, ‘not for me’: these are feehngs containing \nso much sorcery and sugar that we must be doubly distrustful of \nthem and ask: ‘Are these not perhaps—seductions?’ \nThat we /ike these feehngs (whether because we have them, or \nenjoy their fruits, or merely observe them as spectators) fumishes \nno argument for them, but rather demands that we exercise caution. \nSo let’s be cautious! \n34 Beyond Good and Evil",
    "Zimmern": "It cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender, of sacrifice for one's neighbour, and all self-renunciation-morality, \nmust be mercilessly called to account, and brought to judgment ; just as the aesthetics of \"disinterested contemplation,\" \nunder which the emasculation of art nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience. There is \nfar too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments \"for \nothers\" and \"not for myself,\" for one not needing to be \ndoubly distrustful here, and for one asking promptly: \"Are \n40 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \n\n\nthey not perhaps — deceptions?\" — That they please — him \nwho has them, and him who enjoys their fruit, and also the \nmere spectator — that is still no argument in their favour, but \njust calls for caution. Let us therefore be cautious!"
