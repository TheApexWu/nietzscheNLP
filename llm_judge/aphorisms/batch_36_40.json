I \nmean, not as a deception, as “mere appearance,” an “idea” (in the \nsense of Berkeley and Schopenhauer) but as holding the same rank \nof reality as our affect—as a more primitive form of the world of \naffects in which everything still hes contained in a powerful unity \n37 Cf.: “It might be amusing, perhaps even instructive, to compare Ryle on \nordinary language with W, D. Ross on prima facie duties, There is a close \nresemblance between Oxford deontology and Oxford linguisticism, not least \nin the assumption that duties, hke verbal habits, are ‘leamt in the nursery’ \n[Ryle’s phrase], and that what nurse has told us goes for the rest of the \nworld, too” (John Passmore, “Professor Ryle’s Use of ‘Use’ and \"Usage,\" \nThe Philosophical Review, LXII [January 1954], 62). \n48 “He seeks the true only to do the good.\" \n48 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \n\n\nbefore it undergoes ramifications and developments in the organic \nprocess (and, as is only fair, also becomes tenderer and weaker) \n—as a kind of instinctive life in which all organic functions are still \nsynthetically intertwined along with self-regulation, assimilation, \nnourishment, excretion, and metabohsm—as a pre-form of life. \nIn the end not only is it permitted to make this experiment; the \nconscience of method demands it. Not to assume several kinds of \ncausahty until the experiment of making do with a single one has \nbeen pushed to its utmost limit (to the point of nonsense, if I may \nsay so)—that is a moral of method which one may not shirk today \n—it follows “from its definition,” as a mathematician would say. \nThe question is in the end whether we really recognize the will as \nefficient, whether we believe in the causahty of the will: if we do \n-—and at bottom our faith in this is nothing less than our faith in \ncausahty itself—then we have to make the experiment of positing \nthe causahty of the will hypothetically as the only one. “Will,” of \ncourse, can affect only “will”—and not “matter” (not “nerves,” for \nexample). In short, one has to risk the hypothesis whether will \ndoes not affect will wherever “effects” are recognized—and \nwhether all mechanical occurrences are not, insofar as a force is \nactive in them, will force, effects of will. \nSuppose, finally, we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and ramification of one basic form \nof the will—namely, of the will to power, as my proposition has \nit; suppose all organic functions could be traced back to this will to \npower and one could also find in it the solution of the problem of \nprocreation and nourishment—it is one problem—then one would \nhave gained the right to determine all efficient force univocally as \n—-will to power.

I do not \nmean as a deception, an ‘appearance’, an ‘idea’ (in the Berkeleyan and \nSchopenhaueran sense), but as possessing the same degree of reality as our \nemotions themselves — as a more primitive form of the world of emotions in which \neverything still hes locked in mighty unity and then branches out and develops in \nthe organic process (also, as is only fair, is made weaker and more sensitive), as a \nkind of instinctual life in which all organic functions, together with self-regulation,\nassimilation, nourishment, excretion, metabohsm, are still synthetically bound \ntogether — as an antecedent form of life? — In the end, it is not merely permitted to \nmake this experiment: it is commanded by the conscience of method. Not to assume \nseveral kinds of causahty so long as the experiment of getting along with one has \nnot been taken to its ultimate limits (— to the point of nonsense, if I may say so): \nthat is a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadays — it follows \n‘from its definition’, as a mathematician would say. In the end, the question is \nwhether we really recognize will as efficient, whether we believe in the causahty of \nwill: if we do so — and fundamentally belief in this is precisely our belief in \ncausahty itself — then we have to make the experiment of positing causahty of will \nhypothetically as the only one. ‘Will’ can of course operate only on ‘will’ — and not \non ‘matter’ (not on ‘nerves’, for example —): enough, one must venture the \nhypothesis that wherever ‘effects’ are recognized, will is operating upon will — and \nthat all mechanical occurrences, in so far as a force is active in them, are force of \nwill, effects of will. — Granted finally that one succeeded in explaining our entire \ninstinctual life as the development and ramification of one basic form of will — as \nwill to power, as is my theory — ; granted that one could trace all organic functions \nback to this will to power and could also find in it the solution to the problem of \nprocreation and nourishment — they are one problem — one would have acquired the \nright to define all efficient force unequivocally as: will to power.

We cannot evade this morality of method today: it follows \n‘by definition’, as a mathematician would say. The question is \nultimately whether we really recognize that the will can effect things, \nwhether we believe in the causahty of the will: if we do (and to \nbelieve in this is basically to believe in causahty itself), we must \nexperiment to test hypothetically whether the causahty of the will \nis the only causahty. A ‘will can have an effect only upon another \n‘will, of course, and not upon ‘matter’ (not upon ‘nerves’, for \nexample): one must dare to hypothesize, in short, that wherever \n‘effects’ are identified, a will is having an effect upon another will— \nand that all mechanical events, in so far as an energy is active in \nthem, are really the energy of the will, the effect of the will. \nAssuming, finally, that we could explain our entire instinctual \nlife as the development and differentiation of one basic form of the \nwill (namely the will to power, as my tenet would have it); assuming \nthat one could derive all organic functions from this will to power \nand also find in it the solution to the problem of procreation and \nahmentation (it is all one problem), then we would have won the \nright to designate all effective energy unequivocally as: the will to \npower.

Presupposing always, \nto begin with, that the term \"philosopher\" be not confined \nto the philosopher who writes books, or even introduces his \nphilosophy into books! — Stendhal fumishes a last feature of \nthe portrait of the free-spirited philosopher, which for the \nsake of German taste I will not omit to underhne — for it is \nopposed to German taste. \"Pour etre bon philosophe,\" \nsays this last great psychologist, \"il jaut etre sec, clair, sans \nillusion. Un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une partie du \ncaractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie, \nc'est-d-dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est.\" \nj^ Everything that is profound loves the mask: the proj foundest things have a hatred even of figure and hkeness. \nShould not the contrary only be the right disguise for the \n46 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nshame of a God to go about in? A question worth asking! — \nit would be strange if some mystic has not already ventured \non the same kind of thing. There are proceedings of such \na dehcate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with \ncoarseness and make them unrecognisable; there are actions of love and of an extravagant magnanimity after \nwhich nothing can be wiser than to take a stick and thrash \nthe witness soundly: one thereby obscures his recollection. \nMany a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory, \nin order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the \nsecret: shame is inventive. They are not the worst things \nof which one is most ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask — there is so much goodness in craft. I could \nimagine that a man with something costly and fragile to \nconceal, would roll through life clumsily and rotundly hke \nan old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of \nhis shame requiring it to be so. A man who has depths in \nhis shame meets his destiny and his dehcate decisions upon \npaths which few ever reach, and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate friends may \nbe ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from their eyes, \nand equally so his regained security. Such a hidden nature, \nwhich instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment, and is inexhaustible in evasion of communication, desires and insists that a mask of himself shall occupy his \nplace in the hearts and heads of his friends; and supposing \nhe does not desire it, his eyes will some day be opened to \nthe fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him there — and \nthat it is well to be so. Every profound spirit needs a mask; \nnay, more, around every profound spirit there continually \ngrows a mask, owing to the constantly false, that is to say, \nsuperficial interpretation of every word he utters, every step \nhe takes, every sign of life he manifests. \nII \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 47"

        "Gutenberg": "Alles, was tief ist, hebt die Maske; die allertiefsten Dinge haben\nsogar einen Hass auf Bild und Gleichniss. Sollte nicht erst der\nGegensatz die rechte Verkleidung sein, in der die Scham eines Gottes\neinhergienge? Eine fragwürdige Frage: es wäre wunderhch, wenn nicht\nirgend ein Mystiker schon dergleichen bei sich gewagt hätte. Es giebt\nVorgänge so zarter Art, dass man gut thut, sie durch eine Grobheit zu\nverschütten und unkennthch zu machen; es giebt Handlungen der Liebe\nund einer ausschweifenden Grossmuth, hinter denen nichts räthhcher\nist, als einen Stock zu nehmen und den Augenzeugen durchzuprügeln:\ndamit trübt man dessen Gedächtniss. Mancher versteht sich darauf,\ndas eigne Gedächtniss zu trüben und zu misshandeln, um wenigstens\nan diesem einzigen Mitwisser seine Rache zu haben: - die Scham ist\nerfinderisch. Es sind nicht die schhmmsten Dinge, deren man sich am\nschhmmsten schämt: es ist nicht nur Arghst hinter einer Maske,es giebt so viel Güte in der List. Ich könnte mir denken, dass ein\nMensch, der etwas Kostbares und Verletzhches zu bergen hätte, grob\nund rund wie ein grünes altes schwerbeschlagenes Weinfass durch's\nLeben rollte: die Feinheit seiner Scham will es so. Einem Menschen,\nder Tiefe in der Scham hat, begegnen auch seine Schicksale und zarten\nEntscheidungen auf Wegen, zu denen Wenige je gelangen, und um deren\nVorhandensein seine Nächsten und Vertrautesten nicht wissen dürfen:\nseine Lebensgefahr verbirgt sich ihren Augen und ebenso seine wieder\neroberte Lebens-Sicherheit. Ein solcher Verborgener, der aus Instinkt\ndas Reden zum Schweigen und Verschweigen braucht und unerschöpfhch\nist in der Ausflucht vor Mittheilung, will es und fördert es, dass\neine Maske von ihm an seiner Statt in den Herzen und Köpfen seiner\nFreunde herum wandelt; und gesetzt, er will es nicht, so werden ihm\neines Tages die Augen darüber aufgehn, dass es trotzdem dort eine\nMaske von ihm giebt, - und dass es gut so ist. Jeder tiefe Geist\nbraucht eine Maske: mehr noch, um jeden tiefen Geist wächst\nfortwährend eine Maske, Dank der beständig falschen, nämhch flachen\nAuslegung jedes Wortes, jedes Schrittes, jedes Lebens-Zeichens, das er\ngiebt. -",
