But in saying this I feel I have a duty, \nalmost as much towards them as towards us, their heralds and precursors, us free \nspirits! — to blow away from all of us an ancient and stupid prejudice and \nmisunderstanding which has all too long obscured the concept ‘free spirit’ hke a fog. \nIn all the countries of Europe and hkewise in America there exists at present \nsomething that misuses this name, a very narrow, enclosed, chained up species of \nspirits who desire practically the opposite of that which informs our aims and \ninstincts — not to mention the fact that in regard to those new philosophers \nappearing they must certainly be closed windows and bolted doors. They belong, in \nshort and regrettably, among the /evellers, these falsely named ‘free spirits’ — \neloquent and tirelessly scribbhng slaves of the democratic taste and its ‘modem \nideas’, men without sohtude one and all, without their own sohtude, good clumsy \nfellows who, while they cannot be denied courage and moral respectabihty, are \nunfree and ludicrously superficial, above all in their fundamental inchnation to see \nin the forms of existing society the cause of practically all human failure and \n\n\nmisery: which is to stand the truth happily on its head! What with all their might \nthey would hke to strive after is the universal green pasture happiness of the herd, \nwith security, safety, comfort and an easier life for all; their two most oft-recited \ndoctrines and ditties are ‘equality of rights’ and ‘sympathy for all that suffers’ — an\nsuffering itself they take for something that has to be abolished. We, who are the \nopposite of this, and have opened our eyes and our conscience to the question \nwhere and how the plant ‘man’ has hitherto grown up most vigorously, we think that \nthis has always happened under the opposite conditions, that the perilousness of his \nsituation had first to become tremendous, his powers of invention and dissimulation \n(his ‘spirit’ — ) had, under protracted pressure and constraint, to evolve into subtlet\nand daring, his will to life had to be intensified into unconditional will to power — \nwe think that severity, force, slavery, peril in the street and in the heart, \nconcealment, stoicism, the art of experiment and devilry of every kind, that \neverything evil, dreadful, tyrannical, beast of prey and serpent in man serves to \nenhance the species ‘man’ just as much as does its opposite — we do not say enough \nwhen we say even that much, and at any rate we are, in what we say and do not say \non this point, at the other end from all modem ideology and herd desiderata: at its \nantipodes perhaps? Is it any wonder we ‘free spirits’ are not precisely the most \ncommunicative of spirits? that we do not want to betray in every respect from what \na spirit can free itself and to what it is then perhaps driven? And as for the \ndangerous formula ‘beyond good and evil’ with which we at any rate guard against \nbeing taken for what we are not: we are something different from ‘hbres-penseurs’, \n‘hberi pensatort , ‘Freidenker’, or whatever else all these worthy advocates of \n‘modem ideas’ hke to call themselves. At home in many countries of the spirit, or at \nleast having been guests there; having again and again eluded the agreeable musty \nnooks and comers into which predilection and prejudice, youth, origin, the \naccidents of people and books, or even weariness from wandering seemed to have \nconsigned us; full of mahce towards the lures of dependence which reside in \nhonours, or money, or offices, or raptures of the senses; grateful even to distress and\nchangeful illness because it has always hberated us from some rule and its \n‘prejudice’, grateful to the god, devil, sheep and worm in us, curious to the point of \nvice, investigators to the point of cruelty, with rash fingers for the ungraspable, wit\nteeth and stomach for the most indigestible, ready for every task that demands \nacuteness and sharp senses, ready for every venture thanks to a superfluity of ‘free \nwill’, with fore- and back-souls into whose ultimate intentions no one can easily see, \nwith fore- and backgrounds to whose end no foot may go, hidden under mantles of \nlight, conquerors even though we look hke heirs and prodigals, collectors and \narrangers from mom till night, misers of our riches and our full-crammed \ncupboards, thrifty in leaming and forgetting, inventive in schemata, sometimes \nproud of tables of categories, sometimes pedants, sometimes night owls of labour \neven in broad daylight; yes, even scarecrows when we need to be — and today we \nneed to be: in so far, that is, as we are bom, swom, jealous friends of sohtude, of \nour own deepest, most midnight, most midday sohtude — such a type of man are \nwe, we free spirits! and perhaps you too are something of the same type, you \ncoming men? you new philosophers? — \nPart Three: The Religious Nature",
        "Norman": "After all this, do I really need to add that they will be free, very free \nspirits, these philosophers of the future — and that they certainly will not \njust be free spirits, but rather something more, higher, greater, and fundamentally different, something that does not want to be misunderstood \nor mistaken for anything else? But, in saying this, I feel — towards them \nalmost as much as towards ourselves (who are their heralds and precursors, \nwe free spirits!) — an obhgation to sweep away a stupid old prejudice \nand misunderstanding about all of us that has hung hke a fog around \nthe concept of the “free spirit” for far too long, leaving it completely \nopaque. In all the countries of Europe, and in America as well, there is \nnow something that abuses this name: a very narrow, restricted, chainedup type of spirit whose inchnations are pretty much the opposite of our \nown intentions and instincts (not to mention the fact that this restricted \ntype will be a fully shut window and bolted door with respect to these \napproaching new philosophers).

But in saying this, I feel even towards them (as \ntowards ourselves, the free spirits who are their heralds and \nforerunners!) the obhgation to dispel for both of us a stupid old \nprejudice and misunderstanding that for all too long has \nenshrouded the concept ‘free spirit’ hke a fog. In all the countries \nof Europe and in America now as well, there is something that is \nmisusing this name: a very narrow, trapped, enchained sort of spirit \nwho wants more or less the opposite of what we do, by instinct \nand intention—not to mention that they are bound to be the shut \nwindows and barred doors to those approaching new philosophers. \nThese falsely dubbed ‘free spirits’ belong, short and sour, to the \nlevellers, loquacious scribbhng slaves of the democratic taste and its \n‘modem ideas’: they are all of them people without sohtude, \nwithout their own sohtude, plain well-behaved lads whose courage \nThe Free Spirit 41 \nand honourable propriety cannot be denied. It is just that they are \nunfree and laughably superficial, especially in light of their basic \ntendency to see, more or less, the cause of all human misery and \nfailure in the structures of society up to now, thus happily managing \nto tum truth upside down! What they are trying with all their \nstrength to achieve is a common green pasture of happiness for the \nherd, with safety, security, comfort, ease of life for everyone; their \ntwo most often recited tunes and teachings are ‘Equal rights’ and \n‘Compassion for all suffering-—and they take suffering itself as \n\n\nsomething that must be ehminated. \nWe who are the opposite, who have opened an eye and a conscience to the question of where and how the plant ‘human being’ \nhas most vigorously grown tall, we are of the opinion that this has \nalways happened under the opposite conditions: that the precariousness of the plant’s situation had first to increase enormously; that \nits power of invention and disguise (its ‘spirit-—) had to become \nsubtle and daring through long periods of pressure and disciphne; \nthat its life-will had to be intensified into an unconditional powerwill. We are of the opinion that harshness, violence, enslavement, \ndanger on the street and in the heart, seclusion, stoicism, the art \nof the tempter and every kind of devilry, that everything evil, \nfrightful, tyrannical, predatory, and snake-hke about humans serves \nto heighten the species ‘human being’ as much as does its opposite. \nTo say only this much, in fact, is not even saying enough, and \nwhether we speak or are silent at this juncture, we find ourselves \nat the other end of all modem ideology and wishful thinking of the \nherd: as their antipodes, perhaps? Is it any surprise that we ‘free \nspirits’ are not the most communicative of spirits? That we do not \nwish to reveal in every case what a spirit can hberate itself from \nand what it may then perhaps be driven to? And as far as concems \nthe dangerous phrase ‘beyond good and evil’, it guards us at least \nagainst being misidentified: we are something other than ‘hbrepenseurs’, ‘hberi pensatori’, ‘freethinkers’,* and whatever other \nnames all these honourable advocates of ‘modem ideas’ might \nchoose to call themselves by.

But while \nI say this, I feel under obhgation almost as much to them \nas to ourselves (we free spirits who are their heralds and \nforerunners), to sweep away from ourselves altogether a \nstupid old prejudice and misunderstanding, which, hke a \nfog, has too long made the conception of \"free spirit\" obscure. In every country of Europe, and the same in America, there is at present something which makes an abuse of \nthis name: a very narrow, prepossessed, enchained class of \nspirits, who desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instincts prompt — not to mention that in respect \nto the new philosophers who are appearing, they must still \nmore be closed windows and bolted doors.

What wonder that we \n^'free spirits\" are not exactly the most communicative spirits? that we do not wish to betray in every respect what ai \nspirit can free itself from, and where perhaps it will then be \ndriven? And as to the import of the dangerous formula, \n\"Beyond Good and Evil,\" with which we at least avoid confusion, we are something else than \"hbres-penseurs,\" \"hberi \npensatori\" \"free-thinkers,\" and whatever these honest advocates of \"modem ideas\" hke to call themselves.
