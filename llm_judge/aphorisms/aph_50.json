    "Gutenberg": "Die Leidenschaft für Gott: es giebt bäurische, treuherzige und\nzudringhche Arten, wie die Luther's, - der ganze Protestantismus\nentbehrt der südhchen dehcatezza. Es giebt ein orientahsches\nAussersichsein darin, wie bei einem unverdient begnadeten oder\nerhobenen Sklaven, zum Beispiel bei Augustin, der auf eine\nbeleidigende Weise aller Vornehmheit der Gebärden und Begierden\nermangelt. Es giebt frauenhafte Zärthchkeit und Begehrhchkeit darin,\nwelche schamhaft und unwissend nach einer unio mystica et physica\ndrängt: wie bei Madame de Guyon. In vielen Fällen erscheint sie\nwunderhch genug als Verkleidung der Pubertät eines Mädchens oder\n\nJünghngs; hier und da selbst als Hysterie einer alten Jungfer, auch\nals deren letzter Ehrgeiz: - die Kirche hat das Weib schon mehrfach in\neinem solchen Falle heihg gesprochen.",

There is sometimes an Oriental ecstasy worthy of a \nslave who, without deserving it, has been pardoned and elevated— \nfor example, in Augustine, who lacks in a truly offensive manner \nall nobility of gestures and desires.

Madame Guyon was imprisoned from 1695 \nto 1703. The Quietist doctrine was condemned by Innocent XII in 1699. \n(These dates are taken from The Oxford Companion to French Literature, \nOxford, Clarendon Press, 1959.) \nWHAT IS RELIGIOUS 65 \nsi \nSo far the most powerful human beings have still bowed worshipfully before the saint as the riddle of self-conquest and dehberate final renunciation, Why did they bow? In him—and as it were \nbehind the question mark of his fragile and miserable appearance \n—they sensed the superior force that sought to test itself in such a \nconquest, the strength of the will in which they recognized and \nhonored their own strength and delight in dominion: they honored \nsomething in themselves when they honored the saint. Moreover, \nthe sight of the saint awakened a suspicion in them: such an enormity of denial, of anti-nature will not have been desired for nothing, they said to and asked: themselves, There may be a reason for \nit, some very great danger about which the ascetic, thanks to his secret comforters and visitors, might have inside information. In \nshort, the powerful of the world leamed a new fear before him; \nthey sensed a new power, a strange, as yet unconquered enemy— \nit was the “will to power” that made them stop before the saint. \nThey had to ask im ——",
