    "Gutenberg": "Man muss sich selbst seine Proben geben, dafür dass man zur\nUnabhängigkeit und zum Befehlen bestimmt ist; und dies zur rechten\nZeit. Man soll seinen Proben nicht aus dem Wege gehn, obgleich sie\nvielleicht das gefährhchste Spiel sind, das man spielen kann, und\nzuletzt nur Proben, die vor uns selber als Zeugen und vor keinem\nanderen Richter abgelegt werden. Nicht an einer Person hängen bleiben:\nund sei sie die gehebteste, - jede Person ist ein Gefängniss, auch\nein Winkel. Nicht an einem Vaterlande hängen bleiben: und sei es das\n\nleidendste und hülfbedürftigste, - es ist schon weniger schwer, sein\nHerz von einem siegreichen Vaterlande los zu binden. Nicht an einem\nMitleiden hängen bleiben: und gälte es höheren Menschen, in deren\nseltne Marter und Hülflosigkeit uns ein Zufall hat bhcken lassen.\nNicht an einer Wissenschaft hängen bleiben: und locke sie Einen mit\nden kostbarsten, anscheinend gerade uns aufgesparten Funden. Nicht an\nseiner eignen Loslösung hängen bleiben, an jener wollüstigen Feme und\nFremde des Vogels, der immer weiter in die Höhe fheht, um immer mehr\nunter sich zu sehn: - die Gefahr des Fhegenden. Nicht an unsem\neignen Tugenden hängen bleiben und als Ganzes das Opfer irgend einer\nEinzelheit an uns werden, zum Beispiel unsrer \"Gastfreundschaft\": wie\nes die Gefahr der Gefahren bei hochgearteten und reichen Seelen ist,\nwelche verschwenderisch, fast gleichgültig mit sich selbst umgehn und\ndie Tugend der Liberahtät bis zum Laster treiben. Man muss wissen,\nsich zu bewahren: stärkste Probe der Unabhängigkeit.",
    "Kaufmann": "One has to test oneself to see that one is destined for independence and command—and do it at the right time. One should \nnot dodge one’s tests, though they may be the most dangerous \n22 This section is obviously of great importance for the student of Nietz \nsche: it suggests plainly that the surface meaning noted by superficial \nbrowsers often masks Nietzsche's real meaning, which in extreme cases may \napproximate the opposite of what the words might suggest to hasty readers. \nIn this sense “beyond good and evil” and “will to power,” “master morality” \nand “hardness” and “cruelty” may be masks that ehcit reactions quite inAppropriate to what hes behind them. Specific examples will be found on \nter pages, \nKarl aspera has called attention to the similarity between Nietzsche and \nKierkegaard at this point, in his lecture on Kierkegaard and Nietzsche (Existentiahsm from Dostoevsky to Sartre, ed, Kaufmann, New York, Meridian \nBooks, 1956, B 165). See also Jaspers’ Nietzsche (1936, pp. 358ff.; pp. \n405i. of the English version, Tucson, University of Arizona Press, 1965, \nwhich unfortunately omits the references for the quotations), \n52 BEYOND GOOD AND &VIL \ngame one could play and are tests that are taken in the end before \nno witness or judge but ourselves, \nNot to remain stuck to a person—not even the most loved— \nevery person is a prison, also a nook.?® Not to remain stuck to a fatherland—not even if it suffers most and needs help most—it is \nless difficult to sever one’s heart from a victorious fatherland. Not \nto remain stuck to some pity—not even for higher men into whose \nrare torture and helplessness some accident allowed us to look.24 \nNot to remain stuck to a sciencee—even if it should lure us with the \nmost precious finds that seem to have been saved up precisely for \nus.*5 Not to remain stuck to one’s own detachment, to that voluptuous remoteness and strangeness of the bird who flees ever higher to \nsee ever more below him—the danger of the fher. Not to remain \nstuck to our own virtues and become as a whole the victim of some \ndetail in us, such as our hospitahty, which is the danger of dangers \nfor superior and rich souls who spend themselves lavishly, almost \nindifferently, and exaggerate the virtue of generosity into a vice. \nOne must know how to conserve oneself: the hardest test of independence,",
    "Hollingdale": "One must test oneself to see whether one is destined for independence and \ncommand; and one must do so at the proper time. One should not avoid one's tests, \nalthough they are perhaps the most dangerous game one could play and are in the \nend tests which are taken before ourselves and before no other judge. Not to cleave \nto another person, though he be the one you love most — every person is a prison, \nalso a nook and comer. Not to cleave to a fatherland, though it be the most suffering \nand in need of help — it is already easier to sever your heart from a victorious \nfatherland. Not to cleave to a feehng of pity, though it be for higher men into whose \nrare torment and helplessness chance allowed us to look. Not to cleave to a science, \nthough it lures one with the most precious discoveries seemingly reserved precisely \nfor us. Not to cleave to one's own detachment, to that voluptuous remoteness and \nstrangeness of the bird which fhes higher and higher so as to see more and more \nbeneath it — the danger which threatens the fher. Not to cleave to our own virtues \nand become as a whole the victim of some part of us, of our ‘hospitahty’ for \nexample, which is the danger of dangers for rich and noble souls who expend \nthemselves prodigally, almost indifferently, and take the virtue of hberahty to the \npoint where it becomes a vice. One must know how to conserve oneself: the stemest \ntest of independence.",
    "Norman": "its “prejudice,” grateful to the god, devil, sheep, and maggot in us, curious \nto a fault, researchers to the point of cruelty, with unmindful fingers for \nthe incomprehensible, with teeth and stomachs for the indigestible, ready \nfor any trade that requires a quick wit and sharp senses, ready for any risk, \nthanks to an excess of “free will,” with front and back souls whose ultimate \naim is clear to nobody, with fore- and backgrounds that no foot can fully \ntraverse, hidden under the cloak of light, conquerors, even if we look hke \nheirs and prodigals, collectors and gatherers from moming until evening, \n\n\nmiserly with our riches and our cabinets filled to the brim, economical \nwith what we leam and forget, inventive in schemata, sometimes proud \nof tables of categories, sometimes pedants, sometimes night owls at work, \neven in bright daylight; yes, even scarecrows when the need arises — and \ntoday the need has arisen: inasmuch as we are bom, swom, jealous friends \nof sohtude, our own deepest, most midnightly, noon-hkely sohtude.

    "Zimmern": "One must subject oneself to one's own tests that one is \ndestined for independence and command, and do so at the \nright time. One must not avoid one's tests, although they \nconstitute perhaps the most dangerous game one can play, \nand are in the end tests made only before ourselves and \nbefore no other judge. Not to cleave to any person, be it \neven the dearest — every person is a prison and also a recess. Not to cleave to a fatherland, be it even the most \nsuffering and necessitous — it is even less difficult to detach \none's heart from a victorious fatherland. Not to cleave to \na S5anpathy, be it even for higher men, into whose pecuhar \ntorture and helplessness chance has given us an insight. \nNot to cleave to a science, though it tempt one with the \nmost valuable discoveries, apparently specially reserved for \nus. Not to cleave to one's own hberation, to the voluptuous \ndistance and remoteness of the bird, which always fhes further aloft in order always to see more under it — the danger \nof the fher. Not to cleave to our own virtues, nor become \nas a whole a victim to any of our specialties, to our \"hospitahty\" for instance, which is the danger of dangers for \nhighly developed and wealthy souls, who deal prodigally, \nalmost indifferently with themselves, and push the virtue of \nhberahty so far that it becomes a vice. One must know \nhow to conserve oneself — the best test of independence. \n\n\nI \n4* \nA new order of philosophers is appearing; I shall venture \nto baptize them by a name not without danger. As far as I \nunderstand them, as far as they allow themselves to be \n48 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nunderstood — for it is their nature to wish to remain something of a puzzle — these philosophers of the future might \nrightly, perhaps also wrongly, claim to be designated as \n\"tempters.\" This name itself is after all only an attempt, \nor, if it be preferred, a temptation."
