    "Gutenberg": "Das, was an der Rehgiosität der alten Griechen staunen macht, ist die\nunbändige Fülle von Dankbarkeit, welche sie ausströmt: - es ist eine\nsehr vornehme Art Mensch, welche so vor der Natur und vor dem Leben\nsteht! - Später, als der Pöbel in Griechenland zum Übergewicht kommt,\nüberwuchert die Furcht auch in der Religion; und das Christenthum\nbereitete sich vor.-",
    "Kaufmann": "What is amazing about the rehgiosity of the ancient Greeks is \nthe enormous abundance of gratitude it exudes: it is a very noble \ntype of man that confronts nature and life in this way.® \n\n\nLater, when the rabble gained the upper hand in Greece, fear \nbecame rampant in religion, too—and the ground was prepared \nfor Christianity. —",
    "Hollingdale": "What astonishes one about the rehgiosity of the ancient Greeks is the tremendous \n\n\namount of gratitude that emanates from it — the kind of man who stands thus before \nnature and before life is a very noble one! — Later, when the rabble came to \npredominate in Greece, fear also overran religion; and Christianity was preparing \nitself. —",
    "Norman": "What is amazing about the rehgiosity of ancient Greeks is the excessive \namount of gratitude that flows out from it: — it takes a very noble type of \nperson to face nature and life hke this! — Later, when the rabble gained \nprominence in Greece, religion became overgrown with fear as well, and \nChristianity was on the horizon. —",
    "Faber": "The astonishing thing about the ancient Greeks’ rehgiosity is the \ntremendous wealth of gratitude pouring forth from it: only a very \nnoble kind of person can face nature and life hke this! \nAfterwards, when the rabble got the upper hand in Greece, fear \nran rampant in their religion, too; and the ground was prepared \nfor Christianity.",
    "Zimmern": "i \nThat which is so astonishing in the religious life of the \nancient Greeks is the irrestrainable stream of gratitude which \nit pours forth — it is a very superior kind of man who takes \nsuch an attitude towards nature and life. — ^Later on, when \nthe populace got the upper hand in Greece, fear became \nrampant also in religion; and Christianity was preparing itself. \nSO \nThe passion for God: there are churhsh, honest-hearted, \nand importunate kinds of it, hke that of Luther — the whole \nof Protestantism lacks the southem dehcatezza. There is an \nOriental exaltation of the mind in it, hke that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave, as in the case of St. \nAugustine, for instance, who lacks in an offensive manner, \nall nobility in bearing and desires. There is a feminine \ntendemess and sensuality in it, which modestly and unconsciously longs for a unio mystica et physica, as in the \ncase of Madame de Guy on. In many cases it appears, curiously enough, as the disguise of a girl's or youth's puberty; \nhere and there even as the hysteria of an old maid, also \nas her last ambition. The Church has frequently canonised \nthe woman in such a case."
