Mag das Volk glauben, dass Erkennen ein zu Ende-Kennen sei,\nder Philosoph muss sich sagen: \"wenn ich den Vorgang zerlege, der in\ndem Satz `ich denke` ausgedrückt ist, so bekomme ich eine Reihe von\nverwegenen Behauptungen, deren Begründung schwer, vielleicht unmöghch\nist, - zum Beispiel, dass ich es bin, der denkt, dass überhaupt ein\nEtwas es sein muss, das denkt, dass Denken eine Thätigkeit und Wirkung\nseitens eines Wesens ist, welches als Ursache gedacht wird, dass es\nein `Ich` giebt, endhch, dass es bereits fest steht, was mit Denken\nzu bezeichnen ist, - dass ich weiss, was Denken ist. Denn wenn ich\nnicht darüber mich schon bei mir entschieden hätte, wonach sollte ich\nabmessen, dass, was eben geschieht, nicht vielleicht `Wollen` oder\n`Fühlen` sei?

Aber es dünkt mich immer wieder, dass\nSchopenhauer auch in diesem Falle nur gethan hat, was Philosophen\neben zu thun pflegen: dass er ein Volks-Vorurtheil übemommen und\nübertrieben hat. Wollen scheint mir vor Allem etwas Comphcirtes,\nEtwas, das nur als Wort eine Einheit ist, - und eben im Einen Worte\nsteckt das Volks-Vorurtheil, das über die allzeit nur geringe Vorsicht\nder Philosophen Herr geworden ist. Seien wir also einmal vorsichtiger,\nseien wir \"unphilosophisch\" -, sagen wir: in jedem Wollen ist erstens\neine Mehrheit von Gefühlen, nämhch das Gefühl des Zustandes, von dem\nweg, das Gefühl des Zustandes, zu dem hin, das Gefühl von diesem \"weg\"\nund \"hin\" selbst, dann noch ein begleitendes Muskelgefühl, welches,\nauch ohne dass wir \"Arme und Beine\" in Bewegung setzen, durch eine Art\nGewohnheit, sobald wir \"wollen\", sein Spiel beginnt. Wie also Fühlen\nund zwar vielerlei Fühlen als Ingredienz des Willens anzuerkennen ist,\nso zweitens auch noch Denken: in jedem Willensakte giebt es einen\ncommandirenden Gedanken; - und man soll ja nicht glauben, diesen\nGedanken von dem \"Wollen\" abscheiden zu können, wie als ob dann noch\nWille übrig bhebe! Drittens ist der Wille nicht nur ein Complex von\nFühlen und Denken, sondem vor Allem noch ein Affekt: und zwar jener\nAffekt des Commando's. Das, was \"Freiheit des Willens\" genannt wird,\nist wesenthch der Überlegenheits-Affekt in Hinsicht auf Den, der\ngehorchen muss: \"ich bin frei, \"er\" muss gehorchen\" - dies Bewusstsein\nsteckt in jedem Willen, und ebenso jene Spannung der Aufmerksamkeit,\njener gerade Bhck, der ausschhesshch Eins fixirt, jene unbedingte\nWerthschätzung \"jetzt thut dies und nichts Anderes Noth\", jene innere\nGewissheit darüber, dass gehorcht werden wird, und was Alles noch zum\nZustande des Befehlenden gehört. Ein Mensch, der will -, befiehlt\neinem Etwas in sich, das gehorcht oder von dem er glaubt, dass es\n\ngehorcht. Nun aber beachte man, was das Wunderhchste am Willen ist,\n- an diesem so vielfachen Dinge, für welches das Volk nur Ein Wort\nhat: insofem wir im gegebenen Falle zugleich die Befehlenden und\nGehorchenden sind, und als Gehorchende die Gefühle des Zwingens,\nDrängens, Drückens, Widerstehens, Bewegens kennen, welche sofort nach\ndem Akte des Willens zu beginnen pflegen; insofem wir andererseits\ndie Gewohnheit haben, uns über diese Zweiheit vermöge des\nsynthetischen Begriffs \"ich\" hinwegzusetzen, hinwegzutäuschen, hat\nsich an das Wollen noch eine ganze Kette von irrthümhchen Schlüssen\nund folghch von falschen Werthschätzungen des Willens selbst\nangehängt, - dergestalt, dass der Wollende mit gutem Glauben glaubt,\nWollen genüge zur Aktion. Weil in den allermeisten Fällen nur gewollt\nworden ist, wo auch die Wirkung des Befehls, also der Gehorsam, also\ndie Aktion erwartet werden durfte, so hat sich der Anschein in das\nGefühl übersetzt, als ob es da eine Nothwendigkeit von Wirkung gäbe;\ngenug, der Wollende glaubt, mit einem ziemhchen Grad von Sicherheit,\ndass Wille und Aktion irgendwie Eins seien -, er rechnet das Gehngen,\ndie Ausführung des Wollens noch dem Willen selbst zu und geniesst\ndabei einen Zuwachs jenes Machtgefühls, welches alles Gehngen mit\nsich bringt. \"Freiheit des Willens\" - das ist das Wort für jenen\nvielfachen Lust-Zustand des Wollenden, der befiehlt und sich zugleich\nmit dem Ausführenden als Eins setzt, - der als solcher den Triumph\nüber Widerstände mit geniesst, aber bei sich urtheilt, sein Wille\nselbst sei es, der eigenthch die Widerstände überwinde. Der Wollende\nnimmt dergestalt die Lustgefühle der ausführenden, erfolgreichen\nWerkzeuge, der dienstbaren \"Unterwillen\" oder Unter-Seelen - unser\nLeib ist ja nur ein Gesellschaftsbau vieler Seelen - zu seinem\nLustgefühle als Befehlender hinzu. L'effet c'est moi: es begiebt sich\nhier, was sich in jedem gut gebauten und glückhchen Gemeinwesen\nbegiebt, dass die regierende Klasse sich mit den Erfolgen des\nGemeinwesens identificirt. Bei allem Wollen handelt es sich\nschlechterdings um Befehlen und Gehorchen, auf der Grundlage, wie\ngesagt, eines Gesellschaftsbaus vieler \"Seelen\": weshalb ein Philosoph\nsich das Recht nehmen sollte, Wollen an sich schon unter den\nGesichtskreis der Moral zu fassen: Moral nämhch als Lehre von den\nHerrschafts-Verhältnissen verstanden, unter denen das Phänomen \"Leben\"\nentsteht. -",
        "Kaufmann": "Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as if it were \nthe best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given \nus to understand that the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and completely known, without subtraction or addition. \nBut again and again it seems to me that in this case, too, Schopenhauer only did what philosophers are in the habit of doing—he \nadopted a popular prejudice and exaggerated it. Wilhng seems to \nme to be above all something complicated, something that is a unit \nonly as a word—and it is precisely in this one word that the popular \nprejudice lurks, which has defeated the always inadequate caution of philosophers. So let us for once be more cautious, let us be \n“unphilosophical”: let us say that in all wilhng there is, first, a \nplurahty of sensations, namely, the sensation of the state “away \nfrom which,” the sensation of the state “towards which,” the sensations of this “from” and “towards” themselves, and then also an accompanying muscular sensation, which, even without our putting \ninto motion “arms and legs,” begins its action by force of habit as \nsoon as we “will” anything. \nTherefore, just as sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are to be recognized as ingredients of the will, so, secondly, \nshould thinking also: in every act of the will there is a ruhng \nthought—let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from \nthe “wilhng,” as if any will would then remain over! \nThird, the will is not only a complex of sensation and thinking, but it is above all an affect, and specifically the affect of the \ncommand, That which is termed “freedom of the will” is essentially the affect of superiority in relation to him who must obey:. “I \nam free, ‘he’ must obey”—this consciousness is inherent in every \nwill; and equally so the straining of the attention, the straight look \nthat fixes itself exclusively on one aim, the unconditional evaluation that “this and nothing else is necessary now,” the inward \n26 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \n\n\ncertainty that obedience will be rendered—-and whatever else belongs to the position of the commander. A man who wills commands something within himself that renders obedience, or that he \nbelieves renders obedience. \nBut now let us notice what is strangest about the will—this \nmanifold thing for which the people have only one word: inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the same time the \ncommanding and the obeying parties, and as the obeying party we \nknow the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, \nand motion, which usually begin immediately after the act of will; \ninasmuch as, on the other hand, we are accustomed to disregard \nthis duahty, and to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic concept “I,” a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and \nconsequently of false evaluations of the will itself, has become attached to the act of wilhng—to such a degree that he who wills believes sincerely that wilhng suffices for action. Since in the great \nmajority of cases there has been exercise of will only when the effect of the command—that is, obedience; that is, the action—was \nto be expected, the appearance has translated itself into the feehng, \nas if there were a necessity of effect. In short, he who wills believes \nwith a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow \none; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the wilhng, to the \nwill itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power \nwhich accompanies all success. \n“Freedom of the will”—that is the expression for the complex \nstate of delight of the person exercising vohtion, who commands \nand at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order—who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but \nthinks within himself that it was really his will itself that overcame \nthem. In this way the person exercising vohtion adds the feehngs of \ndelight of his successful executive instruments, the useful “underwills” or under-souls—indeed, our body is but a social structure \ncomposed of many souls—to his feehngs of delight as commander. \nL'effet c'est moi? what happens here is what happens in every \nwell-constructed and happy commonwealth; namely, the goveming \n22 “7 am the effect.” \nON THE PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS 27 \nclass identifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth. In all \nwilhng it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on \nthe basis, as already said, of a social structure composed of many \n“souls.” Hence a philosopher should claim the right to include willing as such within the sphere of morals—morals being understood \nas the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of “life” comes to be.",
        "Hollingdale": "Philosophers are given to speaking of the will as if it were the best-known thing in \nthe world; Schopenhauer, indeed, would have us understand that the will alone is \ntruly known to us, known completely, known without deduction or addition. But it \nseems to me that in this case too Schopenhauer has done only what philosophers in \ngeneral are given to doing: that he has taken up a popular prejudice and exaggerated \nit. Wilhng seems to me to be above all something complicated, something that is a \nunity only as a word — and it is precisely in this one word that the popular prejudice \nresides which has overbome the always inadequate caution of the philosophers. Let \nus therefore be more cautious for once, let us be ‘unphilosophical’ — let us say: in al\nwilhng there is, first of all, a plurahty of sensations, namely the sensation of the \ncondition we leave, the sensation of the condition towards which we go, the \nsensation of this ‘leaving’ and ‘going’ itself, and then also an accompanying \nmuscular sensation which, even without our putting ‘arms and legs’ in motion, \ncomes into play through a kind of habit as soon as we ‘will’. As feehngs, and indeed \nmany varieties of feehng, can therefore be recognized as an ingredient of will, so, in\nthe second place, can thinking: in every act of will there is a commanding thought — \nand do not imagine that this thought can be separated from the ‘wilhng’, as though \nwill would then remain over! Thirdly, will is not only a complex of feehng and \n\n\nthinking, but above all an affect: and in fact the affect of command. What is called \n‘freedom of will’ is essentially the affect of superiority over him who must obey: ʻI \nam free, “he” must obey’ — this consciousness adheres to every will, as does that \ntense attention, that straight look which fixes itself exclusively on one thing, that \nunconditional evaluation ‘this and nothing else is necessary now’, that inner \ncertainty that one will be obeyed, and whatever else pertains to the state of him who \ngives commands. A man who wills — commands something in himself which obeys \nor which he believes obeys. But now observe the strangest thing of all about the will \n— about this so complex thing for which people have only one word: inasmuch as in \nthe given circumstances we at the same time command and obey, and as the side \nwhich obeys know the sensations of constraint, compulsion, pressure, resistance, \nmotion which usually begin immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the \nother hand, we are in the habit of disregarding and deceiving ourselves over this \nduahty by means of the synthetic concept ‘T; so a whole chain of erroneous \nconclusions and consequently of false evaluations of the will itself has become \nattached to the will as such — so that he who wills believes wholeheartedly that \nwilhng suffices for action. Because in the great majority of cases wilhng takes place\nonly where the effect of the command, that is to say obedience, that is to say the \naction, was to be expected, the appearance has translated itself into the sensation, as\nif there were here a necessity of effect. Enough: he who wills believes with a \ntolerable degree of certainty that will and action are somehow one — he attributes \nthe success, the carrying out of the wilhng, to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an\nincrease of that sensation of power which all success brings with it. ‘Freedom of \nwill’ — is the expression for that complex condition of pleasure of the person who \nwills, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of \nthe command — who as such also enjoys the triumph over resistances involved but \nwho thinks it was his will itself which overcame these resistances. He who wills \nadds in this way the sensations of pleasure of the successful executive agents, the \nserviceable ‘under-wills’ or under-souls — for our body is only a social structure \ncomposed of many souls — to his sensations of pleasure as commander. L'effet, c'est \nmoi: what happens here is what happens in every well-constructed and happy \ncommonwealth: the ruhng class identifies itself with the successes of the \ncommonwealth. In all wilhng it is absolutely a question of commanding and \nobeying, on the basis, as I have said already, of a social structure composed of \nmany ‘souls’: on which account a philosopher should claim the right to include \nwilhng as such within the field of morality: that is, of morality understood as the \ntheory of the relations of dominance under which the phenomenon ‘life’ arises. —",

        "Faber": "Philosophers tend to speak about the will as if everyone in the \nworld knew all about it; Schopenhauer even suggested that the will \nwas the only thing we actually do know, know through and through, \nknow without additions or subtractions. But I continue to think \nthat even in this case Schopenhauer was only doing what philosophers simply tend to do: appropriating and exaggerating a common \nprejudice. As I see it, the act of wilhng is above all something \ncomplicated, something that has unity only as a word—and this \ncommon prejudice of using only one word has overridden the \nphilosophers’ caution (which was never all that great anyway). So \nlet us be more cautious for once, let us be ‘unphilosophical’. Let \nus say that in every act of wilhng there is first of all a multiphcity \nof feehngs, namely the feehng of the condition we are moving away \nfrom and the feehng of the condition we are moving towards; the \nfeehng of this ‘away’ and this ‘towards’; and then a concomitant \nfeehng in the muscles that, without our actually moving ‘arms and \nlegs’, comes into play out of a kind of habit, whenever we ‘will’. \nSecond, just as we must recognize feehng, and indeed many kinds \n\n\nof feehng, as an ingredient of the will, so must we hkewise recognize \nthinking: in every act of will there is a commanding thought, and \nwe must not deceive ourselves that this thought can be separated \noff from ‘wilhng’, as if we would then have any will left over! \nThird, the will is not merely a complex of feehngs and thoughts, \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers 19 \nit is above all an emotion, and in fact the emotion of command. \nWhat is called ‘freedom of the will’ is essentially the emotion of \nsuperiority felt towards the one who must obey: ‘I am free, “he” \nmust obey.’ This consciousness hes in every will, as does also a \ntense alertness, a direct gaze concentrated on one thing alone, an \nunconditional assessment that ‘now we must have this and nothing \nelse’, an inner certainty that obedience will follow, and everything \nelse that goes along with the condition of giving commands. A \nperson who wills: this person is commanding a Something in \nhimself that obeys, or that he thinks is obeying. \nBut let us now consider the strangest thing about the will, about \nthis multifarious thing that the common people call by one word \nalone. In any given case, we both command and obey, and when \nwe obey we know the feehngs of coercion, pressure, oppression, \nresistance, and agitation that begin immediately after the act of \nwill. On the other hand, we are in the habit of ignoring or overlooking this division by means of the synthetic concept ‘I’. Thus, \na whole series of erroneous conclusions and therefore of false \nassessments of the will itself has been appended to wilhng in such \na way that the person who wills now believes with complete faith \nthat wilhng 7s enough for action. Because in the vast majority of \ncases, wilhng has only occurred when there is also the expectation \nthat the effect of the command—that is obedience, action—will \nfollow, this impression has been translated into the feehng that there \nis a necessary effect; suffice it to say, the person wilhng thinks with \nsome degree of certainty that will and action are somehow one: he \nattributes his success in carrying out his wilhng to the will itself \nand in this way enjoys an increase in that feehng of power that \naccompanies any kind of success. ‘Freedom of the will’—that is \nthe word for that complex pleasurable condition experienced by the \nperson wilhng who commands and simultaneously identifies himself \nwith the one who executes the command—as such he can share in \nenjoying a triumph over resistance, while secretly judging that it \nwas actually his will that overcame that resistance. Thus the person \nwilhng adds to his pleasurable feehng as commander the pleasurable \nfeehngs of the successful executing instrument, the serviceable \n‘underwill’ or under-soul (our body after all is nothing but a social \nstructure of many souls). L'effet c'est mot:* what is occurring here \noccurs in every well-structured happy community where the ruhng \n\n\n20 Beyond Good and Evil \nclass identifies with the successes of the community as a whole. As \nwe have said, every act of wilhng is simply a matter of commanding \nand obeying, based on a social structure of many ‘souls’; for this \nreason a philosopher should claim the right to comprehend wilhng \nfrom within the sphere of ethics: ethics, that is, understood as the \ntheory of hierarchical relationships among which the phenomenon \n‘life’ has its origins.",
        "Zimmern": "Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though \nit were the best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us to understand that the will alone is really \nknown to us, absolutely and completely known, without deduction or addition. But it again and again seems to me that \nin this case Schopenhauer also only did what philosophers are \nin the habit of doing — he seems to have adopted a popular \nprejudice and exaggerated it. Wilhng — seems to me to be \nabove all something complicated, something that is a unity \nonly in name — and it is precisely in a name that popular \nprejudice lurks, which has got the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages. So let us for \nonce be more cautious, let us be \"unphilosophical\": let us \nsay that in all wilhng there is firstly a plurahty of sensations, namely, the sensation of the condition \"away from \nwhich we go,\" the sensation of the condition \"towards which \nwe go,\" the sensation of this \"from\" and \"towards\" itself, \nand then besides, an accompanying muscular sensation, \nwhich, even without our putting in motion \"arms and legs,\" \ncommences its action by force of habit, directly we *'wiH\" \nanything. Therefore, just as sensations (and indeed many \nkinds of sensations) are to be recognised as ingredients of \nthe will, so, in the second place, thinking is also to be recognised; in every act of the will there is a ruhng thought; — \nand let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from \nthe \"wilhng,\" as if the will would then remain over! In the \n20 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nthird place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and \nthinking, but it is above all an emotion, and in fact the \nemotion of the command. That which is termed \"freedom \nof the will\" is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: \"I am free, 'he' must obey\" — \nthis consciousness is inherent in every will; and equally so \nthe straining of the attention, the straight look which fixes \nitself exclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment \nthat \"this and nothing else is necessary now,\" the inward \ncertainty that obedience will be rendered — and whatever else \npertains to the position of the commander. A man who wills \ncommands something within himself which renders obedience, \nor which he believes renders obedience. But now let us \nnotice what is the strangest thing about the will, — this affair \nso extremely complex, for which the people have only one \nname. Inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the \nsame time the commanding and the obeying parties, and as \nthe obe5dng party we know the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the \nother hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duahty, \nand to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic \nterm \"I\": a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false judgments about the will itself, has become attached to the act of wilhng — to such a degree that \nhe who wills believes firmly that wilhng suffices for action. \nSince fn the majority of cases there has only been exercise of \nwill when the effect of the command — consequently obedience, and therefore action — was to be expected, the appearance has translated itself into the sentiment, as if there were \na necessity of effect; in a word, he who wills believes with \na fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow \none; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the wilhng, \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 21 \nto the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success. \"Freedom of \nWill\" — that is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising vohtion, who commands and \nat the same time identifies himself with the executor of the \norder — who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, \nbut thinks within himself that it was really his own will \nthat overcame them. In this way the person exercising vohtion adds the feehngs of delight of his successful executive \ninstruments, the useful \"underwills\" or under-souls — indeed, \nour body is but a social structure composed of many souls — ■ \nto his feehngs of delight as commander. L'effet c'est mot: \nwhat happens here is what happens in every well-constructed \nand happy commonwealth, namely, that the goveming class \nidentifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth. In \nall wilhng it is absolutely a question of commanding and \nobeying, on the basis, as already said, of a social structure \ncomposed of many \"souls\"; on which account a philosopher \nshould claim the right to include wilhng-as-such within the \nsphere of morals — regarded as the doctrine of the relations \nof supremacy imder which the phenomenon of \"life\" manifests itself."

The yeaming for ‘freedom of the will’ in the \nsuperlative metaphysical sense that unfortunately still prevails in \nthe minds of the half-educated, the yeaming to bear complete and \nfinal responsibility for one’s own actions and to relieve God, the \nworld, one’s ancestors, coincidence, society from it—this is really \nnothing less than being that same causa sui and, with a daring \ngreater than Miinchhausen’s,* dragging yourself by your hair out \nof the swamp of nothingness and into existence. Now, if someone \ncan see through the cloddish simplicity of this famous concept ‘free \nwill’ and ehminate it from his mind, I would then ask him to take \nhis ‘enlightenment’ a step further and hkewise ehminate from his \nhead the opposite of the non-concept ‘free will’: I mean the ‘unfree \nwil? which amounts to a misuse of cause and effect. One should \nnot make the mistake of concretizing ‘cause’ and ‘effect’? as do \nthe natural scientists (and whoever else today naturahzes in their \nthinking . . .), in conformity with the prevalent mechanistic foolishness that pushes and tugs at the cause until it ‘has an effect’; ‘cause’ \nand ‘effect’ should be used only as pure concepts, as conventional \nfictions for the purpose of description or communication, and \nnot for explanation. In the ‘in itself’ there is nothing of ‘causal \nassociations’, of ‘necessity’, of ‘psychological constraint’; the effect \ndoes not follow ‘upon the cause’, no ‘law’ govems it. We alone are \nthe ones who have invented causes, succession, reciprocity, relativity, coercion, number, law, freedom, reason, purpose; and if we \nproject, if we mix this world of signs into things as if it were an \n‘in itself’, we act once more as we have always done, that is, \nmythologically. The ‘unfree will’ is mythology: in real life it is only \na matter of strong and weak wills. \nWhenever a thinker sniffs out coercion, necessity, obhgation, \n22 Beyond Good and Evil \npressure, constraint in any ‘causal connection’ or ‘psychological \nnecessity’, it is almost always a symptom of where his own inadequacy hes: to feel this particular way is reveahng—the person is \nreveahng himself. And if I have observed correctly, the ‘constraint \nof the will is always conceived as a problem from two completely \nOpposite standpoints, but always in a profoundly personal way: the \none group will not hear of rehnquishing their ‘responsibility’, their \nbelief in themselves, their personal right to take ‘heir credit (the vain \nraces are of this type); conversely, the other group wants to be \nresponsible for nothing, guilty of nothing, and out of their inner \nself-contempt they yeam to cast off their own selves one way or \nanother. When this latter group writes books nowadays, they tend \nto take up the cause of criminals; a sort of sociahstic compassion \nis their nicest disguise. And indeed, it is surprising how much \nprettier the fatahsm of the weak-willed can look when it presents \nitself as ‘la religion de la souffrance humaine’;* that is what zt \nmeans by ‘good taste’.",
