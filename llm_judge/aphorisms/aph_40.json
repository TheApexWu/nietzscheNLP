    "Gutenberg": "Alles, was tief ist, hebt die Maske; die allertiefsten Dinge haben\nsogar einen Hass auf Bild und Gleichniss. Sollte nicht erst der\nGegensatz die rechte Verkleidung sein, in der die Scham eines Gottes\neinhergienge? Eine fragwürdige Frage: es wäre wunderhch, wenn nicht\nirgend ein Mystiker schon dergleichen bei sich gewagt hätte. Es giebt\nVorgänge so zarter Art, dass man gut thut, sie durch eine Grobheit zu\nverschütten und unkennthch zu machen; es giebt Handlungen der Liebe\nund einer ausschweifenden Grossmuth, hinter denen nichts räthhcher\nist, als einen Stock zu nehmen und den Augenzeugen durchzuprügeln:\ndamit trübt man dessen Gedächtniss. Mancher versteht sich darauf,\ndas eigne Gedächtniss zu trüben und zu misshandeln, um wenigstens\nan diesem einzigen Mitwisser seine Rache zu haben: - die Scham ist\nerfinderisch. Es sind nicht die schhmmsten Dinge, deren man sich am\nschhmmsten schämt: es ist nicht nur Arghst hinter einer Maske,es giebt so viel Güte in der List. Ich könnte mir denken, dass ein\nMensch, der etwas Kostbares und Verletzhches zu bergen hätte, grob\nund rund wie ein grünes altes schwerbeschlagenes Weinfass durch's\nLeben rollte: die Feinheit seiner Scham will es so. Einem Menschen,\nder Tiefe in der Scham hat, begegnen auch seine Schicksale und zarten\nEntscheidungen auf Wegen, zu denen Wenige je gelangen, und um deren\nVorhandensein seine Nächsten und Vertrautesten nicht wissen dürfen:\nseine Lebensgefahr verbirgt sich ihren Augen und ebenso seine wieder\neroberte Lebens-Sicherheit. Ein solcher Verborgener, der aus Instinkt\ndas Reden zum Schweigen und Verschweigen braucht und unerschöpfhch\nist in der Ausflucht vor Mittheilung, will es und fördert es, dass\neine Maske von ihm an seiner Statt in den Herzen und Köpfen seiner\nFreunde herum wandelt; und gesetzt, er will es nicht, so werden ihm\neines Tages die Augen darüber aufgehn, dass es trotzdem dort eine\nMaske von ihm giebt, - und dass es gut so ist. Jeder tiefe Geist\nbraucht eine Maske: mehr noch, um jeden tiefen Geist wächst\nfortwährend eine Maske, Dank der beständig falschen, nämhch flachen\nAuslegung jedes Wortes, jedes Schrittes, jedes Lebens-Zeichens, das er\ngiebt. -",

    "Hollingdale": "Everything profound loves the mask; the profoundest things of all hate even image \nand parable. Should not nothing less than the opposite be the proper disguise under \nwhich the shame of a god goes abroad? A questionable question: it would be strange \n\n\nif some mystic or other had not already ventured to meditate some such thing. \nThere are occurrences of so dehcate a description that one does well to bury them \nand make them unrecognizable with a piece of coarseness; there are acts of love \nand extravagant magnanimity after which nothing is more advisable than to take a \nstick and give the eyewitness a thrashing and so confuse his memory. Some know \nhow to confuse and mistreat their own memory, so as to take revenge at least on this \nsole confidant — shame is inventive. It is not the worst things of which one is most \nashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask — there is so much goodness in \ncunning. I could believe that a man who had something fragile and valuable to \nconceal might roll through life thick and round as an old, green, thick-hooped wine \nbarrel: the refinement of his shame would have it so. A man whose shame has depth \nenounters his destinies and dehcate decisions too on paths which very few ever \nreach and of whose existence his intimates and neighbours may not know: his \nmortal danger is concealed from their eyes, as is the fact that he has regained his \nsureness of life. Such a hidden man, who instinctively uses speech for silence and \nconcealment and is inexhaustible in evading communication, wants a mask of him \nto roam the heads and hearts of his friends in his stead, and he makes sure that it \ndoes so; and supposing he does not want it, he will one day come to see that a mask \nis there in spite of that — and that that is a good thing. Every profound spirit needs \nmask: more, around every profound spirit a mask is continually growing, thanks to \nthe constantly false, that is to say shallow interpretation of every word he speaks, \nevery step he takes, every sign of life he gives. —",
    "Norman": "Everything profound loves masks; the most profound things go so far as to \nhate images and hkenesses. Wouldn't just the opposite be a proper disguise \nfor the shame of a god? A questionable question: it would be odd 1f some \nmystic hadn't already risked something similar himself. There are events \nthat are so dehcate that it is best to cover them up with some coarseness \nand make them unrecognizable. There are acts of love and extravagant \ngenerosity in whose aftermath nothing is more advisable than to take a \nstick and give the eye-witnesses a good beating: this will obscure any \nmemory traces. Many people are excellent at obscuring and abusing their \nown memory, so they can take revenge on at least this one accessory: — \nshame is highly resourceful. It is not the worst things that we are the most \nashamed of. Mahcious cunning is not the only thing behind a mask — \nthere is so much goodness in cunning. I could imagine that a man with \nsomething precious and vulnerable to hide would roll through life, rough \nand round hke an old, green, heavy-hooped wine cask; the subtlety of his \nshame will want it this way. A man with something profound in his shame \nencounters even his fate and dehcate decisions along paths that few people \nhave ever found, paths whose existence must be concealed from his closest \nand most trusted friends. His mortal danger is hidden from their eyes, \nand so is his regained sense of confidence in life. Somebody hidden in this \nway — who instinctively needs speech in order to be silent and concealed, \nand is tireless in evading communication — wants and encourages a mask \nof himself to wander around, in his place, through the hearts and heads of \nhis friends. And even if this is not what he wants, he will eventually reahze \nthat a mask of him has been there all the same, — and that this is for the best. \n15 “To bea good philosopher you have to be dry, clear, and without illusions.

    "Faber": "Everything deep loves a mask; the very deepest things even have a \nhatred for image and parable. Wouldn’t an antithesis be a more \nfitting disguise if the shame of a god were to walk abroad? A \nquestionable question: it would be strange if some mystic had not \nalready dared to ask himself something hke it. There are experiences \nof such a dehcate nature that it is well to conceal them by a coarse \nact and make them unrecognizable; there are actions of love and \nextravagant generosity after which nothing is more advisable than \nto take a stick and thrash the eyewitness, thus to cloud his memory. \nSome people know how to cloud and abuse their own memories, \nto take revenge on this one confidant, at least: shame is inventive. \nIt is not the worst things that cause us the worst shame: wicked \ncunning is not the only thing behind a mask—there is so much \nkindness in cunning.* I could imagine that a man who had something precious and fragile to hide might roll through life as rough \nand round as an old green heavily banded wine barrel: that is how \nhis refined shame would have it. A man whose shame is deep will \nencounter even his destinies and dehcate choices upon roads that \nfew people ever find and whose existence must be kept from his \nneighbours and closest friends: his mortal danger is hidden from \ntheir eyes, and also his regained mortal confidence. This secretive \none, whose instincts bid him speak in order to silence and be silent, \nwho is inexhaustible in evading communication, this person wants \nand demands that in his stead a mask inhabit the hearts and minds \nof his friends; and should it be that this is something he does not \nwant, then one day his eyes will be opened to the fact that a mask \nof him is there nevertheless, and that that is good. Every deep \nThe Free Spirit 39 \nspirit needs a mask: not only that, around every deep spirit a mask \nis continually growing, thanks to the constantly false, that is to say, \n\n\nshallow interpretations of his every word, his every step, every sign \nof life that he gives. — \n4I \nThose of us who are destined to be independent and to command \nmust in retum set ourselves our own tests—and set them at the \nproper time. We should not try to get out of our tests, even though \nthey may be the most dangerous game we can play, and though they \nare really only tests performed for ourselves as witnesses and for \nno other judge. Not to be dependent on any one person, not even \nthe most beloved—every person is a prison, and a nook. Not to be \ndependent on a fatherland, not even the most suffering and needy— \nit is certainly easier to detach your heart from a victorious fatherland. Not to be dependent on pity, not even if it were for higher \nmen into whose extraordinary suffering and helplessness we have \naccidentally seen. Not to be dependent on any science, not even one \nthat would tempt us with the most precious discoveries, seemingly \nreserved just for us. Not to be dependent even on our own detachment, on the voluptuous faraway foreignness of the bird, who \nconstantly fhes up to ever greater heights so that it can see ever \nmore beneath it—the danger of the fher. Not to be dependent on \nour own virtues, nor allow our wholeness to be sacrificed to some \nsingularity about ourselves, our ‘hospitahty’, for example, as is the \ndanger of dangers for ardent and generous hearts who are prodigal, \nalmost uncaring with themselves, and practise the virtue of hberahty until it is a vice.
