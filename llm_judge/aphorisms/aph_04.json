    "Gutenberg": "Die Falschheit eines Urtheils ist uns noch kein Einwand gegen ein\nUrtheil; darin khngt unsre neue Sprache vielleicht am fremdesten. Die\nFrage ist, wie weit es lebenfördemd, lebenerhaltend, Arterhaltend,\nvielleicht gar Art-züchtend ist; und wir sind grundsätzhch geneigt zu\nbehaupten, dass die falschesten Urtheile (zu denen die synthetischen\nUrtheile a priori gehören) uns die unentbehrhchsten sind, dass\nohne ein Geltenlassen der logischen Fiktionen, ohne ein Messen\nder Wirkhchkeit an der rein erfundenen Welt des Unbedingten,\nSich-selbst-Gleichen, ohne eine beständige Fälschung der Welt durch\ndie Zahl der Mensch nicht leben könnte, - dass Verzichtleisten auf\nfalsche Urtheile ein Verzichtleisten auf Leben, eine Vemeinung des\nLebens wäre. Die Unwahrheit als Lebensbedingung zugestehn: das heisst\nfreihch auf eine gefährhche Weise den gewohnten Werthgefühlen\nWiderstand leisten; und eine Philosophie, die das wagt, stellt sich\ndamit allein schon jenseits von Gut und Böse.",
    "Kaufmann": "The falseness of a judgment is for us not necessarily an objection to a judgment; in this respect our new language may sound \nstrangest. The question is to what extent it is life-promoting, lifepreserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-cultivating, \n4 Folly, stupidity, silhness: one of Nietzsche's favorite French words, \n5 “Man is the measure of all things.” Protagoras, bom about 480 B.O, \n12 BEYOND GOOD AND BVIL \nAnd we are fundamentally inclined to claim that the falsest judgments (which include the synthetic judgments a priori)® are the \nmost indispensable for us; that without accepting the fictions of \nlogic, without measuring reality against the purely invented world \nof the unconditional and self-identical, without a constant falsification of the world by means of numbers, man could not live—that \nrenouncing false judgments would mean renouncing life and a \ndenial of life. To recognize untruth as a condition of life—that certainly means resisting accustomed value feehngs in a dangerous \nway; and a philosophy that risks this would by that token alone \nplace itself beyond good and evil.",
    "Hollingdale": "The falseness of a judgement is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgement: it \nis here that our new language perhaps sounds strangest. The question is to what \nextent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even speciesbreeding; and our fundamental tendency is to assert that the falsest judgements (to \nwhich synthetic judgements a priori belong) are the most indispensable to us, that \nwithout granting as true the fictions of logic, without measuring reality against the \npurely invented world of the unconditional and self-identical, without a continual \nfalsification of the world by means of numbers, mankind could not live — that to \nrenounce false judgements would be to renounce life, would be to deny life. To \nrecognize untruth as a condition of life: that, to be sure, means to resist customary \nvalue-sentiments in a dangerous fashion; and a philosophy which ventures to do so \nplaces itself, by that act alone, beyond good and evil.",
    "Norman": "We do not consider the falsity of a judgment as itself an objection to a judgment; this is perhaps where our new language will sound most foreign. The \nquestion is how far the judgment promotes and preserves life, how well it \npreserves, and perhaps even cultivates, the type. And we are fundamentally inclined to claim that the falsest judgments (which include synthetic \njudgments a priori) are the most indispensable to us, and that without accepting the fictions of logic, without measuring reality against the wholly \ninvented world of the unconditioned and self-identical, without a constant \nfalsification of the world through numbers, people could not live — that a \nrenunciation of false judgments would be a renunciation of life, a negation \nof life. To acknowledge untruth as a condition of life: this clearly means \nresisting the usual value feehngs in a dangerous manner; and a philosophy that risks such a thing would by that gesture alone place itself beyond \ngood and evil.",
    "Faber": "We do not ‘object to a judgement just because it is false; this is \nprobably what is strangest about our new language. The question \nis rather to what extent the judgement furthers life, preserves life, \npreserves the species, perhaps even cultivates the species; and we \nare in principle inclined to claim that judgements that are the most \nfalse (among which are the synthetic a priori judgements)* are the \nmost indispensable to us, that man could not live without accepting \nlogical fictions, without measuring reality by the purely invented \nworld of the unconditional, self-referential, without a continual \nfalsification of the world by means of the number—that to give up \nfalse judgements would be to give up life, to deny life. Admitting \nuntruth as a condition of life: that means to resist famihar values \nin a dangerous way; and a philosophy that dares this has already \nplaced itself beyond good and evil. \n8 Beyond Good and Evil",
    "Zimmern": "The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic judgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that without a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable, without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers, man could not live—that the renunciation of false opinions would be a renunciation of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A CONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so, has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil."
