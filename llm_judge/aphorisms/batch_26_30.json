Wer nicht im Verkehr mit Menschen\ngelegenthch in allen Farben der Noth, grün und grau vor Ekel,\nÜberdruss, Mitgefühl, Verdüsterung, Vereinsamung schillert, der ist\ngewiss kein Mensch höheren Geschmacks; gesetzt aber, er nimmt alle\ndiese Last und Unlust nicht freiwilhg auf sich, er weicht ihr\nimmerdar aus und bleibt, wie gesagt, still und stolz auf seiner Burg\nversteckt, nun, so ist Eins gewiss: er ist zur Erkenntniss nicht\ngemacht, nicht vorherbestimmt. Denn als solcher würde er eines Tages\nsich sagen müssen \"hole der Teufel meinen guten Geschmack! aber die\nRegel ist interessanter als die Ausnahme, - als ich, die Ausnahme!\"\n- und würde sich hinab begeben, vor Allem \"hinein\". Das Studium des\ndurchschnitthchen Menschen, lang, emsthaft, und zu diesem Zwecke\nviel Verkleidung, Selbstüberwindung, Vertrauhchkeit, schlechter\nUmgang - jeder Umgang ist schlechter Umgang ausser dem mit\nSeines-Gleichen -: das macht ein nothwendiges Stück der\nLebensgeschichte jedes Philosophen aus, vielleicht das unangenehmste,\nübelriechendste, an Enttäuschungen reichste Stück. Hat er aber Glück,\nwie es einem Glückskinde der Erkenntniss geziemt, so begegnet er\neigenthchen Abkürzem und Erleichterem seiner Aufgabe, - ich meine\nsogenannten Cynikem, also Solchen, welche das Thier, die Gemeinheit,\ndie \"Regel\" an sich einfach anerkennen und dabei noch jenen Grad von\nGeistigkeit und Kitzel haben, um über sich und ihres Gleichen vor\nZeugen reden zu müssen: - mitunter wälzen sie sich sogar in Büchem\nwie auf ihrem eignen Miste. Cynismus ist die einzige Form, in welcher\ngemeine Seelen an Das streifen, was Redhchkeit ist; und der höhere\nMensch hat bei jedem gröberen und feineren Cynismus die Ohren\naufzumachen und sich jedes Mal Glück zu wünschen, wenn gerade vor ihm\nder Possenreisser ohne Scham oder der wissenschafthche Satyr laut\n\nwerden. Es giebt sogar Fälle, wo zum Ekel sich die Bezauberung mischt:\nda nämhch, wo an einen solchen indiskreten Bock und Affen, durch eine\nLaune der Natur, das Genie gebunden ist, wie bei dem Abbé Gahani, dem\ntiefsten, scharfsichtigsten und vielleicht auch schmutzigsten Menschen\nseines Jahrhunderts - er war viel tiefer als Voltaire und folghch\nauch ein gut Theil schweigsamer. Häufiger schon geschieht es, dass,\nwie angedeutet, der wissenschafthche Kopf auf einen Affenleib, ein\nfeiner Ausnahme-Verstand auf eine gemeine Seele gesetzt ist, - unter\nÄrzten und Moral-Physiologen namenthch kein seltenes Vorkommniss. Und\nwo nur Einer ohne Erbitterung, vielmehr harmlos vom Menschen redet als\nvon einem Bauche mit zweierlei Bedürfnissen und einem Kopfe mit Einem;\nüberall wo Jemand immer nur Hunger, Geschlechts-Begierde und Eitelkeit\nsieht, sucht und sehn will, als seien es die eigenthchen und einzigen\nTriebfedem der menschhchen Handlungen; kurz, wo man \"schlecht\" vom\nMenschen redet - und nicht einmal schhmm -, da soll der Liebhaber\nder Erkenntniss fein und fleissig hinhorchen, er soll seine Ohren\nüberhaupt dort haben, wo ohne Entrüstung geredet wird. Denn der\nentrüstete Mensch, und wer immer mit seinen eignen Zähnen sich selbst\n(oder, zum Ersatz dafür, die Welt, oder Gott, oder die Gesellschaft)\nzerreisst und zerfleischt, mag zwar morahsch gerechnet, höher stehn\nals der lachende und selbstzufriedene Satyr, in jedem anderen Sinne\naber ist er der gewöhnhchere, gleichgültigere, unbelehrendere Fall.\nUnd Niemand lügt soviel als der Entrüstete. -",
        "Kaufmann": "Every choice human being strives instinctively for a citadel \nand a secrecy where he is saved from the crowd, the many, the \ngreat majority—-where he may forget “men who are the rule,” being their exception—excepting only the one case in which he is \npushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct, as a seeker \nafter knowledge in the preat and exceptional sense. Anyone who, \nin intercourse with men, does not occasionally ghsten in all the \ncolors of distress, green and gray with disgust, satiety, sympathy, \ngloominess, and lonehness, is certainly not a man of elevated \ntastes; supposing, however, that he does not take all this burden \nand disgust upon himself voluntarily, that he persistently avoids it, \nand remains, as I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, \none thing is certain: he was not made, he was not predestined, for \nknowledge. If he were, he would one day have to say to himself: \n“The devil take my good taste! but the rule is more interesting than \nthe exception—than myself, the exception!” And he would go \ndown, and above all, he would go “inside.” \n5 An echo of the Prologue to Zarathustra. \n38 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nThe long and serious study of the average man, and consequently much disguise, self-overcoming, famiharity, and bad contact (all contact is bad contact except with one’s equals) —this \nconstitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every philosopher, \nperhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and disappointing part. If \nhe is fortunate, however, as a favorite child of knowledge should \nbe, he will encounter suitable shortcuts and helps for his task; I \nmean so-called cynics, those who simply recognize the animal, the \ncommonplace, and “the rule” in themselves, and at the same time \nstill have that degree of spirituality and that itch which makes them \ntalk of themselves and their hkes before witnesses—sometimes \nthey even wallow in books, as on their own dung. \nCynicism is the only form in which base souls approach honesty; and the higher man must hsten closely to every coarse or subtle cynicism, and congratulate himself when a clown without shame \nor a scientific satyr speaks out precisely in front of him. \nThere are even cases where enchantment mixes with the disgust—namely, where by a freak of nature genius is tied to some \nsuch indiscreet billygoat and ape, as in the case of the Abbé Gahani,® the profoundest, most clear-sighted, and perhaps also filthiest \nman of his century—he was far profounder than Voltaire and consequently also a good deal more tacitum. It happens more frequently, as has been hinted, that a scientific head is placed on an \nape’s body, a subtle exceptional understanding in a base soul, an \noccurrence by no means rare, especially among doctors and physiologists of morality. And whenever anyone speaks without bitterness, quite innocently, of man as a belly with two requirements, \nand a head with one; whenever anyone sees, seeks, and wants to \nsee only hunger, sexual lust, and vanity as the real and only mo8 Abbé Ferdinand Gahani (1728-87) is characterized in The Oxford Companion to French Literature (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1959) as “a Nea» \npohtan, of diminutive size, secretary at the embassy in Paris from 1759 . . . \nof considerable leaming and originality of views, somewhat of a buffoon, \nmuch appreciated in the hterary and philosophical society of the day... \nHis Dialogues sur les blés, a work remarkable for lively wit as well as force \nof argument, combating the doctrines of the more extreme physiocrats, appeared in 1770, after his departure from Paris in 1769.” His letters to Mme \nd’Epinay, Mme Geoffrin, and Mme Necker have also been published, \nTHE FREE SPIRIT 39 \ntives of human actions; in short, when anyone speaks “badly”— \nand not even “wickedly”—of man, the lover of knowledge should \nhsten subtly and dihgently; he should altogether have an open ear \nwherever people talk without indignation. For the indignant and \nwhoever perpetually tears and lacerates with his own teeth himself (or as a substitute, the world, or God, or society) may indeed, \nmorally speaking, stand higher than the laughing and self-satisfied \nsatyr, but in every other sense they are a more ordinary, more indifferent, and less instructive case. And no one hes as much as the \nindignant do.",
        "Hollingdale": "Every superior human being will instinctively aspire after a secret citadel where he \nis set free from the crowd, the many, the majority, where, as its exception, he may \nforget the rule ‘man’ — except in the one case in which, as a man of knowledge in \nthe great and exceptional sense, he will be impelled by an even stronger instinct to \nmake straight for this rule. He who, when trafficking with men, does not \noccasionally ghsten with all the shades of distress, green and grey with disgust, \nsatiety, sympathy, gloom and lonehness, is certainly not a man of an elevated taste; \nbut if he does not voluntarily assume this burden and displeasure, if he continually \navoids it and, as aforesaid, remains hidden quietly and proudly away in his citadel, \nthen one thing is sure: he is not made, not predestined for knowledge. For if he \nwere, he would one day have to say to himself: “The devil can take my good taste! \nthe rule is more interesting than the exception — than I, the exception!’ — and would \ngo down, would above all ‘go in’. The study of the average human being, protracted, \nserious, and with much dissembhng, self-overcoming, intimacy, bad company — all \ncompany is bad company except the company of one's equals — : this constitutes a \nnecessary part of the life story of every philosopher, perhaps the most unpleasant \nand malodorous part and the part most full of disappointments. If he is lucky, \nhowever, as a favourite child of knowledge ought to be, he will encounter means of \nfacihtating and cutting short his task — I mean so-called cynics, that is to say peopl\nwho recognize the animal, the commonness, the ‘rule’ in themselves and yet still \npossess a degree of spirituality and appetite which constrains them to speak of \nthemselves and their kind before witnesses — sometimes they even wallow in books \nas in their own dung. Cynicism is the only form in which common souls come close \nto honesty; and the higher man must prick up his ears at every cynicism, whether \ncoarse or refined, and congratulate himself whenever a buffoon without shame or a \nscientific satyr speaks out in his presence. There are even cases in which fascination \nmingles with the disgust: namely where, by a caprice of nature, such an indiscreet \ngoat and monkey is touched with genius, as in the case of the Abbé Gahani, the \nprofoundest, most sharp-sighted and perhaps also dirtiest man of his century — he \nwas far more profound than Voltaire and consequently also a good deal more silent. \nIt is more often the case that, as already indicated, a scientific head is set on a \nmonkey's body, a refined exceptional understanding on a common soul — no rare \noccurrence, for instance, among physicians and moral physiologists. And whenever \nanyone speaks, without bittemess, rather innocuously, of man as a belly with two \nneeds and a head with one; wherever anyone sees, seeks and wants to see only \nhunger, sexual desire, and vanity, as though these were the actual and sole motives \nof human actions; in brief, whenever anyone speaks ‘badly’ of man — but does not \nspeak ill of him — the lover of knowledge should hsten carefully and with dihgence, \nand he should in general lend an ear whenever anyone speaks without indignation. \n\n\nFor the indignant man, and whoever is continually tearing and rending himself with \nhis teeth (or, instead of himself, the world, or God, or society) may indeed morally \nspeaking stand higher than the laughing and self-satisfied satyr, but in every other \nsense he is the more commonplace, less interesting, less instructive case. And no \none hes so much as the indignant man. —",
        "Norman": "vengeance and mixing their poisons (just try digging up the foundation \nof Spinoza’s ethics and theology!). Not to mention the absurd spectacle of \nmoral indignation, which is an unmistakable sign that a philosopher has \nlost his philosophical sense of humor. 'T'he philosopher's martyrdom, his \n“self-sacrifice for the truth,” brings to light the agitator and actor in him; \nand since we have only ever regarded him with artistic curiosity, it is easy \nto understand the dangerous wish to see many of these philosophers in \ntheir degeneration for once (degenerated into *martyrs\" or loud-mouths \n\n\non their stage or soap-box). It's just that, with this sort of wish we have to \nbe clear about what we will be seeing: — only a satyr-play, only a satirical \nepilogue, only the continuing proof that the long, real tragedy has come to \nan end (assuming that every philosophy was originally a long tragedy — ).",
        "Faber": "Every exceptional person instinctively seeks out his fortress, his \nsecrecy, where he is delivered from the crowd, the multitude, the \nmajority, where he is allowed to forget the rule of ‘humanity’, being \nthe exception to it; in one case, however, an even stronger instinct \npushes him, as a person of great and exceptional knowledge, towards \nthis rule. Anyone who interacts with other people without occasionally displaying all the colours of distress (green and grey with \ndisgust, annoyance, compassion, gloom, lonehness) is surely not a \nman of higher taste; but if on the other hand he declines to assume \nthis whole dispiriting burden and keeps evading it by remaining, \nas described above, tucked away peaceful and proud in his fortress, \nthen one thing is certain: he is not made for, not destined for, \nknowledge. For if he were, he would some day have to say to \nhimself, ‘To hell with my good taste! The rule is more interesting \nthan the exception, more interesting than I, the exception!’—and \nhe would go down, and above all, go ‘into’. The study of the average \nman is a long, serious study, requiring much in the way of disguise, \nself-disciphne, intimacy, bad company (every company is bad \ncompany except that of one’s equals); it makes up a necessary \npart of every philosopher’s biography, and it is perhaps the most \nunpleasant, worst-smelhng part, most rife with disappointment. \nBut if he has the good fortune that befits a fortunate child of \nknowledge, he will encounter others who in fact shorten and lighten \nhis task: I mean the so-called cynics, those people who simply \nacknowledge what is animal-hke, common, the ‘rule’ about themselves and yet still have enough spirituality and excitabihty to need \nto speak about themselves and their kind in front of witnesses— \nsometimes these people even wallow around in books, as in their \nown mire. It is only in the form of cynicism that common souls \n28 Beyond Good and Evil \ncome near to being honest; and the higher man must open his ears \nto every kind of cynicism, whether crude or subtle, and must \ncongratulate himself whenever he is lucky enough to hear a shameless joker or scholarly satyr raise his voice. There are even cases \nthat mix enchantment with the disgust, when a whim of nature \njoins genius to such a prying goat and ape, as in the case of the \nAbbé Gahani,* the most profound, acute, and perhaps dirtiest man \nof his century—he was much more profound than Voltaire and \ntherefore a good deal more tacitum. As I suggested, it is more \ncommon that the scholarly head is set upon an ape’s body, a subtle \nexceptional mind above a common heart—with doctors and the \nphysiologists of morality we find it especially often. And whenever \nsomeone speaks about human beings not bitterly, but neutrally, as \nif he were talking about a belly with two different needs and a head \n\n\nwith but one; whenever someone sees, looks for, and mants to see \nonly hunger, sexual desire, and vanity, as if these were the only \ntrue motives for human behaviour; whenever, in short, someone \nspeaks ‘badly’ about human beings (and not even smicked/y), then \nthe lover of knowledge must pay close and careful attention—he \nmust keep his ears open in general, whenever people speak without \nindignation. For the indignant man and whoever else uses his own \nteeth to mutilate and dismember himself (or God or society in \nplace of himself) may stand higher than the laughing and selfsatisfied satyr in moral terms, but in every other sense he represents \nthe more common, more inconsequential, more uninstructive case. \nAnd only the indignant tell so many /ies—",
        "Zimmern": "Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a \nprivacy, where he is free from the crowd, the many, the majority— where he may forget \"men who are the rule,\" as \ntheir exception; — exclusive only of the case in which he is \npushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct, as \na discemer in the great and exceptional sense.

The German is \nvirtually incapable of presto in his language: thus, it may be fairly concluded, also o\nmany of the most daring and delightful nuances of free, free-spirited thought. Just \nas the buffo and the satyr is strange to him, in his body and in his conscience, so \nAristophanes and Petronius are untranslatable for him. Everything staid, sluggish, \nponderously solemn, all long-winded and boring species of style have been \ndeveloped in profuse multiphcity among the Germans — pardon me for the fact that \neven Goethe's prose is, in its blend of elegance and stiffness, no exception: it is a \nreflection of the ‘good old days’, to which it belongs, and an expression of the \nGerman taste of a time when there still was a ‘German taste’: it was rococo in \nmoribus et artibus.

        "Norman": "28 The hardest thing to translate from one language into another is the tempo of its style, which is grounded in the character of the race, or — to be more physiological — in the average tempo of its metabolism.\" There are well-meaning interpretations that are practically falsifications; they involuntarily debase the original, simply because it has atempo that cannot be translated — a tempo that is brave and cheerful and leaps over and out of every danger in things and in words. Germans are almost incapable of a presto in their language: and so it is easy to see that they are incapable of many of the most delightful and daring nuances of free, free-spirited thought. Since the buffo and the satyr are alien to the German in body and in conscience, Aristophanes and Petronius are as good as untranslatable. Everything ponderous, lumbering, solemnly awkward, every long-winded and boring type of style is developed by the Germans in over-abundant diversity. Forgive me for pointing out that even Goethe's prose, with its mixture of the stiff and the delicate, is no exception; it is both a reflection of the “good old days\" to which it belonged and an expression of the German taste back when there still was a German taste\": it was a Rococo taste, in moribus et artibus. Lessing is an exception, thanks to his actor’s nature that understood and excelled at so much. He was not the translator of Bayle for nothing; he gladly took refuge in the company of Diderot and Voltaire, and still more gladly among the Roman writers of comedy. Even in tempo, Lessing loved free-thinking? and the escape from Germany. But how could the German language — even in the prose of a Lessing — imitate Machiavelli’s tempo — Machiavelli who, in his Principe, lets us breathe the fine, dry air of Florence?
