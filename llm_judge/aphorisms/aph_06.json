    "Gutenberg": "Allmähhch hat sich mir herausgestellt, was jede grosse Philosophie\nbisher war: nämhch das Selbstbekenntnis ihres Urhebers und eine\nArt ungewollter und unvermerkter mémoires; insgleichen, dass die\nmorahschen (oder unmorahschen) Absichten in jeder Philosophie den\neigenthchen Lebenskeim ausmachten, aus dem jedesmal die ganze Pflanze\ngewachsen ist. In der That, man thut gut (und klug), zur Erklärung\ndavon, wie eigenthch die entlegensten metaphysischen Behauptungen\neines Philosophen zu Stande gekommen sind, sich immer erst zu fragen:\nauf welche Moral will es (will er -) hinaus? Ich glaube demgemäss\nnicht, dass ein \"Trieb zur Erkenntniss\" der Vater der Philosophie ist,\nsondem dass sich ein andrer Trieb, hier wie sonst, der Erkenntniss\n(und der Verkenntniss!) nur wie eines Werkzeugs bedient hat. Wer aber\ndie Grundtriebe des Menschen darauf hin ansieht, wie weit sie gerade\nhier als inspirirende Genien (oder Dämonen und Kobolde -) ihr Spiel\ngetrieben haben mögen, wird finden, dass sie Alle schon einmal\nPhilosophie getrieben haben, - und dass jeder Einzelne von ihnen\ngerade sich gar zu geme als letzten Zweck des Daseins und als\nberechtigten Herm aller übrigen Triebe darstellen möchte. Denn\njeder Trieb ist herrschsüchtig: und als solcher versucht er zu\nphilosophiren. - Freihch: bei den Gelehrten, den eigenthch\nwissenschafthchen Menschen, mag es anders stehn - \"besser\", wenn man\nwill -, da mag es wirkhch so Etwas wie einen Erkenntnisstrieb geben,\nirgend ein kleines unabhängiges Uhrwerk, welches, gut aufgezogen,\ntapfer darauf los arbeitet, ohne dass die gesammten übrigen Triebe\ndes Gelehrten wesenthch dabei betheihgt sind. Die eigenthchen\n\"Interessen\" des Gelehrten hegen deshalb gewöhnhch ganz wo anders,\netwa in der Famihe oder im Gelderwerb oder in der Pohtik; ja es ist\nbeinahe gleichgültig, ob seine kleine Maschine an diese oder jene\nStelle der Wissenschaft gestellt wird, und ob der \"hoffnungsvolle\"\njunge Arbeiter aus sich einen guten Philologen oder Pilzekenner\noder Chemiker macht: - es bezeichnet ihn nicht, dass er dies oder\njenes wird. Umgekehrt ist an dem Philosophen ganz und gar nichts\nUnpersönhches; und insbesondere giebt seine Moral ein entschiedenes\n\nund entscheidendes Zeugniss dafür ab, wer er ist - das heisst, in\nwelcher Rangordnung die innersten Triebe seiner Natur zu einander\ngestellt sind.",
    "Kaufmann": "Gradually it has become clear to me what every great philosophy so far has been: namely, the personal confession of its author and a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir; also that \n\n\nthe moral (or immoral) intentions in every philosophy constituted \nthe real germ of life from which the whole plant had grown. \nIndeed, if one would explain how the abstrusest metaphysical \nclaims of a philosopher really came about, it is always well (and \nwise) to ask first: at what morality does all this (does he) aim? Accordingly, I do not believe that a “drive to knowledge” is the father of philosophy; but rather that another drive has, here as elsewhere, employed understanding (and misunderstanding) as a \nmere instrument. But anyone who considers the basic drives of man \nto see to what extent they may have been at play just here as inspiring spirits (or demons and kobolds) will find that all of them \nhave done philosophy at some time—and that every single one of \nthem would hke only too well to represent just itself as the ultimate \npurpose of existence and the legitimate master of all the other \n14 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \ndrives. For every drive wants to be master—and it attempts to \nphilosophize in that spirit. | \nTo be sure: among scholars who are really scientific men, \nthings may be different—\"better,” if you hke—there you may \nreally find something hke a drive for knowledge, some small, independent clockwork that, once well wound, works on vigorously \nwithout any essential participation from all the other drives of the \nscholar, The real “interests” of the scholar therefore he usually \nsomewhere else—say, in his family, or in making money, or in \npohtics. Indeed, it is almost a matter of total indifference whether \nhis httle machine is placed at this or that spot in science, and \nwhether the “promising” young worker tums himself into a good \nphilologist or an expert on fungi or a chemist: it does not characterize him that he becomes this or that. In the philosopher, conversely, there is nothing whatever that is impersonal;? and above \nall, his morality bears decided and decisive witness to who he is— \nthat is, in what order of rank the innermost drives of his nature \nstand in relation to each other.",
    "Hollingdale": "It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy has hitherto been: \na confession on the part of its author and a kind of involuntary and unconscious \nmemoir; moreover, that the moral (or immoral) intentions in every philosophy have \nevery time constituted the real germ of life out of which the entire plant has grown. \nTo explain how a philosopher's most remote metaphysical assertions have actually \nbeen arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to ask oneself first: what morality does \nthis (does he —) aim at? I accordingly do not believe a “drive to knowledge’ to be the \nfather of philosophy, but that another drive has, here as elsewhere, only employed \nknowledge (and false knowledge!) as a tool. But anyone who looks at the basic \ndrives of mankind to see to what extent they may in precisely this connection have \ncome into play as inspirational spirits (or demons and kobolds — ) will discover that \nthey have all at some time or other practised philosophy — and that each one of \nthem would be only too glad to present itself as the ultimate goal of existence and as \nthe legitimate master of all the other drives. For every drive is tyrannical: and it is\nas such that it tries to philosophize. - In the case of scholars, to be sure, in the ca\nof really scientific men, things may be different — ‘better’, if you will — there may \nreally exist something hke a drive to knowledge there, some httle independent \nclockwork which, when wound up, works bravely on without any of the scholar's \nother drives playing any essential part. The scholar's real ‘interests’ therefore \ngenerally he in quite another direction, perhaps in his family or in making money or \nin pohtics; it is, indeed, almost a matter of indifference whether his httle machine \nset up in this region of science or that, whether the ‘promising’ young worker makes \nhimself into a good philologist or a speciahst in fungus or a chemist — he is not \ncharacterized by becoming this or that. In the philosopher, on the contrary, there is \nnothing whatever impersonal; and, above all, his morality bears decided and \ndecisive testimony to who he is — that is to say, to the order of rank the innermost \ndrives of his nature stand in relative to one another.",
    "Norman": "I have gradually come to reahze what every great philosophy so far has \nbeen: a confession of faith on the part of its author, and a type of involuntary and unself-conscious memoir; in short, that the moral (or immoral) \nintentions in every philosophy constitute the true hving seed from which \nthe whole plant has always grown. Actually, to explain how the strangest \nmetaphysical claims of a philosopher really come about, it is always good \n(and wise) to begin by asking: what morality is it (is ^e —) getting at? Consequently, I do not believe that a “drive for knowledge” is the father of",
    "Faber": "Little by httle I came to understand what every great philosophy \nto date has been: the personal confession of its author, a kind of \nunintended and unwitting memoir; and similarly, that the moral \n(or immoral) aims in every philosophy constituted the actual seed \nfrom which the whole plant invariably grew. Whenever explaining \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers 9 \nhow a philosopher’s most far-fetched metaphysical propositions \nhave come about, in fact, one always does well (and wisely) to ask \nfirst: ‘What morality is it (is he) aiming at? Thus I do not believe \nthat an ‘instinct for knowledge’ is the father of philosophy, but \nrather that here as elsewhere a different instinct has merely made \nuse of knowledge (and kNOwledge!)* as its tool. For anyone who \nscrutinizes the basic human instincts to determine how influential \nthey have been as inspiring spirits (or demons and gobhns) will find \nthat all the instincts have practised philosophy, and that each one \nof them would hke only too well to represent itse/f as the ultimate \naim of existence and as the legitimate master of all other instincts. \nFor every instinct is tyrannical; and as such seeks to philosophize. \nAdmittedly, things may be different (‘better’, if you hke) with \nscholars, the truly scientific people; they may really have something \nhke an instinct for knowledge, some small independent clockwork \nwhich, when properly wound up, works away bravely without necessarily involving all the scholar’s other instincts. That is why a \nscholar’s real ‘interests’ generally he elsewhere entirely, in his family, \nsay, or in the acquisition of wealth, or in pohtics; indeed it is almost \na matter of indifference whether his httle machine is located in this \nbranch of science or that, or whether the ‘promising’ young worker \ntums out to be a good philologist or a mushroom expert or a \n\n\nchemist: what he eventually becomes does not distinguish him. \nAbout the philosopher, conversely, there is absolutely nothing that \nis impersonal; and it is above all his morality which proves decidedly \nand decisively who he is—that is, in what hierarchy the innermost \ndrives of his nature are arranged.",
