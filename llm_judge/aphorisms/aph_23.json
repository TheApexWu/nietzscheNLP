    "Gutenberg": "Die gesammte Psychologie ist bisher an morahschen Vorurtheilen und\nBefürchtungen hängen gebheben: sie hat sich nicht in die Tiefe\ngewagt. Dieselbe als Morphologie und Entwicklungslehre des Willens zur\nMacht zufassen, wie ich sie fasse - daran hat noch Niemand in seinen\nGedanken selbst gestreift: sofem es nämhch erlaubt ist, in dem, was\nbisher geschrieben wurde, ein Symptom von dem, was bisher verschwiegen\nwurde, zu erkennen. Die Gewalt der morahschen Vorurtheile ist tief in\ndie geistigste, in die anscheinend kälteste und voraussetzungsloseste\nWelt gedrungen - und, wie es sich von selbst versteht, schädigend,\nhemmend, blendend, verdrehend. Eine eigenthche Physio-Psychologie hat\nmit unbewussten Widerständen im Herzen des Forschers zu kämpfen, sie\nhat \"das Herz\" gegen sich: schon eine Lehre von der gegenseitigen\nBedingtheit der \"guten\" und der \"schhmmen\" Triebe, macht, als feinere\nImmorahtät, einem noch kräftigen und herzhaften Gewissen Noth und\nÜberdruss, - noch mehr eine Lehre von der Ableitbarkeit aller guten\nTriebe aus den schhmmen. Gesetzt aber, Jemand nimmt gar die Affekte\nHass, Neid, Habsucht, Herrschsucht als lebenbedingende Affekte,\nals Etwas, das im Gesammt-Haushalte des Lebens grundsätzhch und\ngrundwesenthch vorhanden sein muss, folghch noch gesteigert werden\nmuss, falls das Leben noch gesteigert werden soll, - der leidet an\neiner solchen Richtung seines Urtheils wie an einer Seekrankheit. Und\ndoch ist auch diese Hypothese bei weitem nicht die peinhchste und\nfremdeste in diesem ungeheuren fast noch neuen Reiche gefährhcher\nErkenntnisse: - und es giebt in der That hundert gute Gründe dafür,\ndass Jeder von ihm fembleibt, der es - kann! Andrerseits: ist man\neinmal mit seinem Schiffe hierhin verschlagen, nun! wohlan! jetzt\ntüchtig die Zähne zusammengebissen! die Augen aufgemacht! die Hand\nfest am Steuer! - wir fahren geradewegs über die Moral weg, wir\nerdrücken, wir zermalmen vielleicht dabei unsren eignen Rest\nMorahtät, indem wir dorthin unsre Fahrt machen und wagen, - aber\nwas hegt an uns! Niemals noch hat sich verwegenen Reisenden und\n\nAbenteurem eine tiefere Welt der Einsicht eröffnet: und der\nPsychologe, welcher dergestalt \"Opfer bringt\" - es ist nicht das\nsacrifizio dell'intelletto, im Gegentheil! - wird zum Mindesten\ndafür verlangen dürfen, dass die Psychologie wieder als Herrin der\nWissenschaften anerkannt werde, zu deren Dienste und Vorbereitung die\nübrigen Wissenschaften da sind. Denn Psychologie ist nunmehr wieder\nder Weg zu den Grundproblemen.\n\nDer freie Geist.",
    "Kaufmann": "All psychology so far has got stuck in moral prejudices and \nfears; it has not dared to descend into the depths. To understand it \nas morphology and the doctrine of the development of the will to \npower, as I do—nobody has yet come close to doing this even in \nthought—insofar as it is permissible to recognize in what has been \nwritten so far a symptom of what has so far been kept silent. The \npower of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most \nspiritual world, which would seem to be the coldest and most devoid of presuppositions, and has obviously operated in an injurious, \ninhibiting, blinding, and distorting manner. A proper physiopsychology has to contend with unconscious resistance in the heart \nof the investigator, it has “the heart” against it: even a doctrine of \nthe reciprocal dependence of the “good” and the “wicked” drives, \ncauses (as refined immorality) distress and aversion in a still hale \nand hearty conscience—still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of \nall good impulses from wicked ones. If, however, a person should \n\n\nregard even the affects of hatred, envy, covetousness, and the lust \nto rule as conditions of life, as factors which, fundamentally and essentially, must be present in the general economy of life (and must, \ntherefore, be further enhanced if life is to be further enhanced)— \nhe will suffer from such a view of things as from seasickness.

    "Hollingdale": "All psychology has hitherto remained anchored to moral prejudices and timidities: it \nhas not ventured into the depths. To conceive it as morphology and the \ndevelopment-theory of the will to power, as I conceive it — has never yet so much as \nentered the mind of anyone else: in so far as it is permissible to see in what has \nhitherto been written a symptom of what has hitherto been kept silent. The power \nof moral prejudices has penetrated deep into the most spiritual world, which is \napparently the coldest and most free of presuppositions — and, as goes without \nsaying, has there acted in a harmful, inhibiting, blinding, distorting fashion. A \ngenuine physio-psychology has to struggle with unconscious resistances in the heart \nof the investigator, it has ‘the heart’ against it: even a theory of the mutual \ndependence of the ‘good’ and the ‘wicked’ impulses causes, as a more refined \nimmorality, revulsion to a conscience still strong and hearty — and even more a \ntheory of the derivation of all good impulses from wicked ones. Supposing, \nhowever, that someone goes so far as to regard the emotions of hatred, envy, \ncovetousness, and lust for domination as life-conditioning emotions, as something \nwhich must fundamentally and essentially be present in the total economy of life, \nconsequently must be heightened further if life is to be heightened further — he \nsuffers from such a judgement as from seasickness. And yet even this hypothesis is \nfar from being the strangest and most painful in this tremendous, still almost \nunexplored realm of dangerous knowledge — and there are in fact a hundred good \nreasons why everyone should keep away from it who — can! On the other hand: if \nyour ship has been driven into these seas, very well! Now clench your teeth! Keep \nyour eyes open! Keep a firm hand on the helm! — We sail straight over morality and \npast it, we flatten, we crush perhaps what is left of our own morality by venturing to \nvoyage thither — but what do we matter! Never yet has a deeper world of insight \nrevealed itself to daring travellers and adventurers: and the psychologist who in this \nfashion ‘brings a sacrifice’ — it is not the sacrifizio dell'intelletto, on the contrar\nwill at least be entitled to demand in retum that psychology shall again be \nrecognized as the queen of the sciences, to serve and prepare for which the other \nsciences exist. For psychology is now once again the road to the fundamental \nproblems. \nPart Two: The Free Spirit",
    "Norman": "All psychology so far has been stuck in moral prejudices and fears: it has \nnot ventured into the depths. To grasp psychology as morphology and \nthe doctrine of the development of the mill to pomer, which 1s what I have \ndone — nobody has ever come close to this, not even in thought: this, \n\n\nof course, to the extent that we are permitted to regard what has been \nwritten so far as a symptom of what has not been said until now. The \npower of moral prejudice has deeply affected the most spiritual world, \nwhich seems hke the coldest world, the one most hkely to be devoid \nof any presuppositions — and the effect has been manifestly harmful, \nhindering, dazzhng, and distorting. A genuine physio-psychology has to \ncontend with unconscious resistances in the heart of the researcher, it \nhas “the heart\" against it. Even a doctrine of the reciprocal dependence \nof the “good” and the “bad” drives will (as a refined immorality) cause \ndistress and aversion in a strong and sturdy conscience — as will, to an even \ngreater extent, a doctrine of the derivation of all the good drives from the \nbad. But suppose somebody considers even the affects of hatred, envy, \ngreed, and power-lust as the conditioning affects of life, as elements that \nfundamentally and essentially need to be present in the total economy of \nlife, and consequently need to be enhanced where life is enhanced, — this \nperson will suffer from such a train of thought as if from sea-sickness. \nAnd yet even this hypothesis is far from being the most uncomfortable and \nunfamihar in this enormous, practically untouched realm of dangerous \nknowledge: — and there are hundreds of good reasons for people to keep \nout of it, if they — can! On the other hand, if you are ever cast loose \nhere with your ship, well now! come on! clench your teeth! open your \neyes! and grab hold of the helm! — we are saihng straight over and amay \nfrom morality; we are crushing and perhaps destroying the remnants of \nour own morality by daring to travel there — but what do me matter! \nNever before have intrepid voyagers and adventurers opened up a more",
    "Faber": "Until now, all psychology has been brought to a stop by moral \nprejudices and fears: it has not dared to plumb these depths. If we \nmay take previous writing as a symptom of what has also been \nsuppressed, then no one in his thoughts has even brushed these \ndepths as I have, as a morphology and evolutionary theory of the \nwill to power. The force of moral prejudices has reached far into \nthe most spiritual world, a world apparently cold and without \npremiss—and it has obviously had a harmful, inhibiting, blinding, \ndistorting effect. A real physio-psychology must struggle with the \nunconscious resistances in the heart of the researcher, the ‘heart’ \nis working against it; a conscience that is still strong and hearty \nwill be distressed and annoyed even by a theory of the reciprocal \nconditionahty of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ instincts, which seems to be a \nkind of subtle immorality—and even more by a theory of the \nderivation of all good drives from bad ones. But granted that a \nperson takes the emotions of hatred, envy, greed, power hunger as \nconditions for hving, crucial and fundamental to the universal \neconomy of life and therefore in need of intensifying if life is to be \nintensified, he is also a person who suffers from such an orientation \nin judgement as if he were seasick. And yet even this hypothesis is \nby no means the strangest or most painful one in this enormous, \nvirtually new realm of dangerous insights—and in truth there are \na hundred good reasons for everyone to stay away from it if he— \ncan! On the other hand, once your ship has strayed onto this course: \nwell then! All right! Grit your teeth bravely! Open your eyes! Keep \nyour hand at the helm!—we are going to be travelhng beyond \nmorality, and by daring to travel there we may in the process stifle \n24 Beyond Good and Evil \nor crush whatever remnant of morality we have left—but what do \nwe matter! Never yet has a deeper world of insight been opened to \nbold travellers and adventurers; and the psychologist who makes \nthis kind of ‘sacrifice’ (it is mot the sacrifizio dell’intelletto,* quite \nthe contrary!) may demand at least that psychology be recognized \nonce again as the queen of the sciences, which the other sciences \nexist to serve and anticipate. For psychology has once again become \nthe way to basic issues. \n\n\nSECTION TWO \nTHE FREE SPIRIT",
    "Zimmern": "All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and timidities, it has not dared to launch out into \nthe depths. In so far as it is allowable to recognise in that \n\n\n26 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nwhich has hitherto been written, evidence of that which has \nhitherto been kept silent, it seems as if nobody had yef \nharboured the notion of psychology as the Morphology and \nDevelopment-doctrine of the Will to Power, as I conceive \nof it. The power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply \nfnto the most intellectual world, the world apparently most \nindifferent and unprejudiced, and has obviously operated \nIn an injiuious, obstructive, blinding, and distorting manner. \nA proper physio-psychology has to contend with unconscious \nantagonism in the heart of the investigator, it has \"the \nheart\" against it: even a doctrine of the reciprocal conditionalness of the \"good\" and the \"bad\" impulses, causes (as \nrefined immorality) distress and aversion in a still strong \nand manly conscience — still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of all good impulses from bad ones. If, however, a \nperson should regard even the emotions of hatred, envy, \ncovetousness, and imperiousness as life-conditioning emotions, as factors which must be present, fundamentally and \nessentially, in the general economy of life (which must, therefore, be further developed if life is to be further developed), \nhe will suffer from such a view of things as from sea-sickness. \nAnd yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and \nmost painful in this immense and almost new domain of \ndangerous knowledge; and there are in fact a hundred good \nreasons why every one should keep away from it who can \ndo so! On the other hand, if one has once drifted hither \nwith one's bark, well! very good! now let us set our teeth \nfirmly! let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the \nhelm! We sail away right over morality, we crush out, we \ndestroy perhaps the remains of our own morality by daring \nto make our voyage thither — ^but what do we matter! Never \nyet did a projounder world of insight reveal itself to daring \ntravellers and adventurers, and the psychologist who thus \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 27 \n\"makes a sacrifice\" — it is not the sacrifizio dell' intelletto, \non the contrary! — will at least be entitled to demand in retum that psychology shall once more be recognised as the \nqueen of the sciences, for whose service and equipment the \nother sciences exist.
