    "Gutenberg": "Auf welchen Standpunkt der Philosophie man sich heute auch stellen\nmag: von jeder Stelle aus gesehn ist die Irrthümhchkeit der Welt, in\nder wir zu leben glauben, das Sicherste und Festeste, dessen unser\nAuge noch habhaft werden kann: - wir finden Gründe über Gründe dafür,\ndie uns zu Muthmaassungen über ein betrügerisches Princip im \"Wesen\nder Dinge\" verlocken möchten. Wer aber unser Denken selbst, also\n\"den Geist\" für die Falschheit der Welt verantworthch macht - ein\nehrenhafter Ausweg, den jeder bewusste oder unbewusste advocatus dei\ngeht -: wer diese Welt, sammt Raum, Zeit, Gestalt, Bewegung, als\nfalsch erschlossen nimmt: ein Solcher hätte mindestens guten Anlass,\ngegen alles Denken selbst endhch Misstrauen zu lemen: hätte es\nuns nicht bisher den allergrössten Schabemack gespielt? und welche\nBürgschaft dafür gäbe es, dass es nicht fortführe, zu thun, was es\nimmer gethan hat? In allem Emste: die Unschuld der Denker hat etwas\nRührendes und Ehrfurcht Einflössendes, welche ihnen erlaubt, sich auch\nheute noch vor das Bewusstsein hinzustellen, mit der Bitte, dass es\nihnen ehrhche Antworten gebe: zum Beispiel ob es \"real\" sei, und\nwarum es eigenthch die äussere Welt sich so entschlossen vom\nHalse halte, und was dergleichen Fragen mehr sind. Der Glaube an\n\"unmittelbare Gewissheiten\" ist eine morahsche Naivetät, welche\n\nuns Philosophen Ehre macht: aber - wir sollen nun einmal nicht \"nur\nmorahsche\" Menschen sein! Von der Moral abgesehn, ist jener Glaube\neine Dummheit, die uns wenig Ehre macht! Mag im bürgerhchen Leben das\nallzeit bereite Misstrauen als Zeichen des \"schlechten Charakters\"\ngelten und folghch unter die Unklugheiten gehören: hier unter uns,\njenseits der bürgerhchen Welt und ihres Ja's und Nein's, - was sollte\nuns hindem, unklug zu sein und zu sagen: der Philosoph hat nachgerade\nein Recht auf \"schlechten Charakter\", als das Wesen, welches bisher\nauf Erden immer am besten genarrt worden ist, - er hat heute die\nPfhcht zum Misstrauen, zum boshaftesten Schielen aus jedem Abgrunde\ndes Verdachts heraus. - Man vergebe mir den Scherz dieser düsteren\nFratze und Wendung: denn ich selbst gerade habe längst über Betrügen\nund Betrogenwerden anders denken, anders schätzen gelemt und halte\nmindestens ein paar Rippenstösse für die blinde Wuth bereit, mit der\ndie Philosophen sich dagegen sträuben, betrogen zu werden. Warum\nnicht? Es ist nicht mehr als ein morahsches Vorurtheil, dass Wahrheit\nmehr werth ist als Schein; es ist sogar die schlechtest bewiesene\nAnnahme, die es in der Welt giebt. Man gestehe sich doch so viel ein:\nes bestünde gar kein Leben, wenn nicht auf dem Grunde perspektivischer\nSchätzungen und Scheinbarkeiten; und wollte man, mit der tugendhaften\nBegeisterung und Tölpelei mancher Philosophen, die \"scheinbare\nWelt\" ganz abschlaffen, nun, gesetzt, ihr könntet das, - so bhebe\nmindestens dabei auch von eurer \"Wahrheit\" nichts mehr übrig! Ja,\nwas zwingt uns überhaupt zur Annahme, dass es einen wesenhaften\nGegensatz von \"wahr\" und \"falsch\" giebt? Genügt es nicht, Stufen der\nScheinbarkeit anzunehmen und gleichsam hellere und dunklere Schatten\nund Gesammttöne des Scheins, - verschiedene valeurs, um die Sprache\nder Maler zu reden? Warum dürfte die Welt, die uns etwas angeht -,\nnicht eine Fiktion sein? Und wer da fragt: \"aber zur Fiktion gehört\nein Urheber?\" - dürfte dem nicht rund geantwortet werden: Warum?\nGehört dieses \"Gehört\" nicht vielleicht mit zur Fiktion? Ist es\ndenn nicht erlaubt, gegen Subjekt, wie gegen Prädikat und Objekt,\nnachgerade ein Wenig ironisch zu sein? Dürfte sich der Philosoph nicht\nüber die Gläubigkeit an die Grammatik erheben? Alle Achtung vor den\nGouvemanten: aber wäre es nicht an der Zeit, dass die Philosophie dem\nGouvemanten-Glauben absagte? -",
    "Kaufmann": "Whatever philosophical standpoint one may adopt today, \nfrom every point of view the erroneousness of the world in which \nwe think we live is the surest and firmest fact that we can lay eyes \non: we find reasons upon reasons for it which would hke to lure us \nto hypotheses conceming a deceptive principle in “the essence of \nthings.” But whoever holds our thinking itself, “the spirit,” in other \nwords, responsible for the falseness of the world—an honorable \nway out which is chosen by every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei‘©—whoever takes this world, along with space, time, \n\n\n38 Advocate of God: Nietzsche's coinage, modeled after advocatus diaboh, \ndevil's advocate. \n46 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nform, movement, to be falsely inferred—anyone hke that would at \nleast have ample reason to leam to be suspicious at long last of all \nthinking. Wouldn’t thinking have put over on us the biggest hoax \nyet? And what warrant would there be that it would not continue \nto do what it has always done? \nIn all seriousness: the innocence of our thinkers is somehow \ntouching and evokes reverence, when today they still step before \nconsciousness with the request that it should please give them honest answers; for example, whether it is “real,” and why it so resolutely keeps the extemal world at a distance, and other questions \nof that kind. The faith in “immediate certainties” is a moral naiveté \nthat reflects honor on us philosophers; but—after all we should \nnot be “merely moral” men. Apart from morality, this faith is a \nstupidity that reflects httle honor on us. In bourgeois life everpresent suspicion may be considered a sign of “bad character” and \nhence belong among things imprudent; here, among us, beyond \nthe bourgeois world and its Yes and No—what should prevent us \nfrom being imprudent and saying: a philosopher has nothing less \nthan a right to “bad character,” as the being who has so far always \nbeen fooled best on earth; he has a duty to suspicion today, to \nSquint mahciously out of every abyss of suspicion. \nForgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and trope; for I \nmyself have leamed long ago to think differently, to estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived, and I keep \nin reserve at least a couple of jostles for the blind rage with which \nthe philosophers resist being deceived. Why not? It is no more \nthan a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than mere appearance; it is even the worst proved assumption there is in the world. \nLet at least this much be admitted: there would be no life at all if \nnot on the basis of perspective estimates and appearances; and if, \nWith the virtuous enthusiasm and clumsiness of some philosophers, \none wanted to abolish the “apparent world” altogether—well, supposing you could do that, at least nothing would be left of your \n“truth” either, Indeed, what forces us at all to suppose that there is \nan essential opposition of “true” and “false”? Is it not sufficient to \nassume degrees of apparentness and, as it were, lighter and darker \nshadows and shades of appearance—different “values,” to use the \nTHE FREE SPIRIT 47 \n\n\nlanguage of painters? Why couldn’t the world that concems us— \nbe a fiction? And if somebody asked, “but to a fiction there surely \nbelongs an author?”—couldn’t one answer simply: why? Doesn't \nthis “belongs” perhaps belong to the fiction, too? Is it not permitted \nto be a bit ironical about the subject no Jess than the predicate and \nobject? Shouldn’t philosophers be permitted to rise above faith in \ngrammar? All due respect for govemesses—but hasn’t the time \ncome for philosophy to renounce the faith of govemesses? 17",
    "Hollingdale": "Whatever standpoint of philosophy we may adopt today: from every point of view \n\n\nthe erroneousness of the world in which we believe we live is the surest and firmest \nthing we can get our eyes on — we find endless grounds for it which would hke to \nlure us to suppose a deceptive principle in the ‘nature of things’. But he who makes \nour thinking itself, that is to say ‘the mind’, responsible for the falsity of the worl\nan honourable way out taken by every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei — : he \nwho takes this world, together with space, time, form, motion, to be the result of a \nfalse conclusion: such a one would have good cause, to say the least, to leam finally \nto mistrust thinking itself: would it not have played on us the biggest hoax ever? and \nwhat guarantee would there be that it would not go on doing what it has always \ndone? In all seriousness: the innocence of thinkers has something touching and \ninspiring of reverence in it which permits them even today to go up to \nconsciousness and ask it to give them honest answers: whether it is ‘real’, for \nexample, and why it really keeps the extemal world so resolutely at a distance, and \nother questions of the sort. The belief in immediate certainties’ is a piece of moral \nnaivety which does honour to us philosophers: but — we ought not to be ‘merely \nmoral’ men! Apart from the moral aspect, that belief is a piece of stupidity which \ndoes us httle honour! In civil life an ever-ready mistrustfulness may count as a sign \nof ‘bad character’ and thus be an imprudent thing to have: here among us, beyond \nthe civil world and its Yes and No — what is there to stop us from being imprudent \nand saying: the philosopher, as the creature which has hitherto always been most \nfooled on earth, has by now a right to ‘bad character’ — he has today the duty to be \ndistrustful, to squint wickedly up out of every abyss of suspicion. — You must \nforgive me this humorous expression and grimace: for I have long since leamed to \nthink differently, to judge differently on the subject of deceiving and being \ndeceived, and I keep in readiness at least a couple of jabs in the ribs for the blind \nrage with which philosophers resist being deceived. Why not? It is no more than a \nmoral prejudice that truth is worth more than appearance; it is even the worstproved assumption that exists. Let us concede at least this much: there would be no \nlife at all if not on the basis of perspective evaluations and appearances; and if, wit\nthe virtuous enthusiasm and awkwardness exhibited by some philosophers, one \nwanted to abolish the ‘apparent world’ altogether, well, assuming you could do that \n— at any rate nothing would remain of your ‘truth’ either! Indeed, what compels us \nto assume there exists any essential antithesis between ‘true’ and ‘false’? Is it not \nenough to suppose grades of apparentness and as it were lighter and darker shades \nand tones of appearance — different valeurs, to speak in the language of painters? \nWhy could the world which is of any concem to us — not be a fiction? And he who \nthen objects: ‘but to the fiction there belongs an author?’ — could he not be met with \nthe round retort: why? Does this ‘belongs’ perhaps not also belong to the fiction? \nAre we not permitted to be a httle ironical now about the subject as we are about \nthe predicate and object? Ought the philosopher not to rise above the belief in \ngrammar? All due respect to govemesses: but is it not time that philosophy \nrenounced the beliefs of govemesses?",
    "Norman": "It does not matter what philosophical standpoint you might take these \n\n\ndays: any way you look at it, the erroneousness of the world we think we \nlive in is the most certain and sohd fact that our eyes can still grab hold of. \nWe find reason after reason for it, reasons that might lure us into speculations about a deceptive principle in “the essence of things.\" But anyone \nwho makes thinking itself (and therefore “the spirit”) responsible for the \nfalseness of the world (an honorable way out, taken by every conscious or \nunconscious advocatus dei'?), anyone who considers this world, together \nwith space, time, form, and motion, to be falsely inferred — such a person \nwould at the very least have ample cause to grow suspicious of thinking altogether. Hasn't it played the biggest joke on us to date? And what \nguarantee would there be that it wouldn't keep doing what it has always \ndone? In all seriousness, there is something touching and awe-inspiring \nabout the innocence that, to this day, lets a thinker place himself in front \nof consciousness with the request that it please give him /onest answers: \nfor example, whether or not it is “real,” and why it so resolutely keeps \nthe extemal world at arm's length, and other questions hke that. The \nbelief in “immediate certainties” is a moral naiveté that does credit to us \nphilosophers: but — we should stop being “merely moral,” for once! Aside \nfrom morality, the belief in immediate certainties is a stupidity that does \nus httle credit! In bourgeois life, a suspicious disposition might be a sign of \n“bad character\" and consequently considered unwise. But here with us, \nbeyond the bourgeois sphere with its Yeses and Noes, — what is to stop us \nfrom being unwise and saying: “As the creature who has been the biggest \ndupe the earth has ever seen, the philosopher pretty much has a right to \na ‘bad character.’ It is his duty to be suspicious these days, to squint as \nmahciously as possible out of every abyss of mistrust.” — Forgive me for \nplaying jokes with this gloomy grimace and expression: because when it \ncomes to betrayal and being betrayed, I myself leamed a long time ago to \nthink differently and evaluate differently; and my elbow is ready with at \n12 Advocate of God (as opposed to the devil’s advocate).",
    "Faber": "No matter what philosophical standpoint we may take these days, \nlooking out from any position, the erroneousness of the world we \nthink we are hving in is the most certain and concrete thing our \neyes can fasten on: we find a host of reasons for it, reasons that \nmight tempt us to speculate about a deceptive principle in the \n‘nature of things’. But anyone who would try to claim that the falsity \nof the world is due to our thought process, to our ‘intellect’ (an \nhonourable way out, taken by every conscious or unconscious advocatus det),* anyone who takes this world with all its space, time, \nform, movement, to be falsely inferred, would at the very least have \ngood reason to end by distrusting the thought process itself—for \nwouldn’t this thought process have made us the victims of the \ngreatest hoax ever? And what guarantce would we have that it \nwouldn’t go on doing what it has always done? In all seriousness, \nthere is something touching and awe-inspiring in the innocence of \nthinkers that allows them even nowadays to request honest answers \nfrom their consciousness: about whether it is ‘substantial’, for \nexample, or why it insists on keeping the outside world at such a \ndistance, and all sorts of other questions of that kind. The faith in \n‘immediate certainties’ is morally naive, and does honour to us \nphilosophers, but—we are not supposed to be ‘on/y moral’ after \nall! In any but moral terms, our faith in immediate certainties is \nstupid, and does us no great honour! Maybe it is true that in \nbourgeois life an ever-ready distrust is taken as a sign of ‘bad \ncharacter’ and therefore classified as imprudence: here where we \nare, beyond the bourgeois world and its Yes’s and No’s—what is \nthere to keep us from being imprudent and saying that the philosopher has a veritable right to his ‘bad character’, as the creature \nwho so far has always been most made a fool of on earth—these \ndays he has a duty to be distrustful, to squint out as mahciously as \nhe can from the bottom of every abyss of doubt. \nPlease forgive me for the joking tone of this sad caricature: for \na while now, I myself have leamed to think differently about \ndeceiving and being deceived, leamed to assess them differently, so \n\n\nI am always ready to take a few pokes at the philosophers’ blind \nrage at being deceived. Why not? It is nothing but a moral prejudice \nto consider truth more valuable than appearance; it is, in fact, the \nThe Free Spirit 35 \nmost poorly proven assumption in the world. We should admit at \nleast this much: there would be no life at all if not on the basis of \nperspectivist assessments and appearances; and if one wanted to do \naway with the ‘apparent world’ entirely, as some vahantly enthusiastic and foolish philosophers want to do, well then, assuming that \npeople hke you could do that—then at the very least there would \nbe nothing left of your ‘truth’, either! Really, why should we be \nforced to assume that there is an essential difference between ‘true’ \nand ‘false’ in the first place? Isn’t it enough to assume that there \nare degrees of apparency and, so to speak, lighter and darker \nshadows and hues of appearance—different valeurs,* to use the \nlanguage of painters? Why should the world that is relevant to us \nnot be a fiction? And if someone asks, ‘But mustn’t a fiction have \nan author?’ shouldn’t we answer him bluntly, ‘Why? Mustn’t this \n‘mustn’t’ be part of the fiction, too, perhaps? Aren’t we allowed to \nbe a httle bit ironic, not only about predicates and objects, but also \nabout subjects? Shouldn’t the philosopher be able to rise above a \nfaith in grammar? My respects to govemesses, but isn’t it about \ntime that philosophers renounced the religion of govemesses?",
    "Zimmern": "I \nAt whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays, seen from every position, the erroneousness \nof the world in which we think we live is the surest and \nmost certain thing our eyes can light upon: we find proof \nafter proof thereof, which would fain allure us into surmises conceming a deceptive principle in the \"nature of \nthings.\" He, however, who makes thinking itself, and consequently \"the spirit,\" responsible for the falseness of the \nworld — an honourable exit, which every conscious or unconscious advocatus del avails himself of — he who regards \nthis world, including space, time, form, and movement, as \nfalsely deduced, would have at least good reason in the end \nto become distrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been playing upon us the worst of scurvy tricks? and \nwhat guarantee would it give that it would not continue to \ndo what it has always been doing? In all seriousness, the \ninnocence of thinkers has something touching and respectinspiring in it, which even nowadays permits them to wait \nupon consciousness with the request that it will give them \nhonest answers: for example, whether it be \"real\" or not, \nand why it keeps the outer world so resolutely at a distance, \nand other questions of the same description. The belief in \n\"immediate certainties\" is a moral naivete which does honour to us philosophers; but — we have now to cease being \n\"merely moral\" men! Apart from morality, such belief is \na folly which does httle honour to us! If in middle-claJj \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 41 \nte an ever-ready distrust is regarded as the sign of a \"bad \nracter,\" and consequently as an imprudence, here \nlongst us, beyond the middle-class world and its Yeas and \nfays, what should prevent our being imprudent and saying: \nie philosopher has at length a right to \"bad character,\" as \nle being who has hitherto been most befooled on earth — \nhe is now under obhgation to distrustfulness, to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of suspicion. — Forgive me. \nthe joke of this gloomy grimace and tum of expression; for \nI myself have long ago leamed to think and estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived, and I \nkeep at least a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the \nblind rage with which philosophers struggle against being \ndeceived. Why not? It is nothing more than a moral \nprejudice that truth is worth more than semblance; it is, in \nfact, the worst proved supposition in the world. So much \nmust be conceded: there could have been no life at all except upon the basis of perspective estimates and semblances; \nand if, with the virtuous enthusiasm and stupidity of many \nphilosophers, one wished to do away altogether with the \n\"seeming world\" — well, granted that you could do that, — \nat least nothing of your \"truth\" would thereby remain! \nIndeed, what is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an essential opposition of \"true\" and \n■\"false\"? Is it not enough to suppose degrees of seemingness, and as it were lighter and darker shades and tones of \nsemblance — different valeurs, as the painters say? Why \nmight not the world which concems us — be a fiction? And \n.to any one who suggested: \"But to a fiction belongs an \noriginator?\" — might it not be bluntly rephed: Why? May \nnot this \"belong\" also belong to the fiction? Is it not at \nlength permitted to be a httle ironical towards the subject, \njust as towards the predicate and object? Might not the \n42 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nphilosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar? All \nrespect to govemesses, but is it not time that philosc^hy \nshould renounce govemess-faith?"
