    "Gutenberg": "Die causa sui ist der beste Selbst-Widerspruch, der bisher ausgedacht\nworden ist, eine Art logischer Nothzucht und Unnatur: aber der\nausschweifende Stolz des Menschen hat es dahin gebracht, sich\ntief und schreckhch gerade mit diesem Unsinn zu verstricken. Das\nVerlangen nach \"Freiheit des Willens\", in jenem metaphysischen\nSuperlativ-Verstande, wie er leider noch immer in den Köpfen der\nHalb-Unterrichteten herrscht, das Verlangen, die ganze und letzte\nVerantworthchkeit für seine Handlungen selbst zu tragen und Gott,\nWelt, Vorfahren, Zufall, Gesellschaft davon zu entlasten, ist nämhch\nnichts Geringeres, als eben jene causa sui zu sein und, mit einer mehr\nals Münchhausen'schen Verwegenheit, sich selbst aus dem Sumpf des\nNichts an den Haaren in's Dasein zu ziehn. Gesetzt, Jemand kommt\ndergestalt hinter die bäurische Einfalt dieses berühmten Begriffs\n\"freier Wille\" und streicht ihn aus seinem Kopfe, so bitte ich ihn\nnunmehr, seine \"Aufklärung\" noch um einen Schritt weiter zu treiben\nund auch die Umkehrung jenes Unbegriffs \"freier Wille\" aus seinem\nKopfe zu streichen: ich meine den \"unfreien Willen\", der auf einen\nMissbrauch von Ursache und Wirkung hinausläuft. Man soll nicht\n\"Ursache\" und \"Wirkung\" fehlerhaft verdinghchen, wie es die\nNaturforscher thun (und wer gleich ihnen heute im Denken naturahsirt\n-) gemäss der herrschenden mechanistischen Tölpelei, welche die\nUrsache drücken und stossen lässt, bis sie \"Wirkt\"; man soll sich der\n\"Ursache\", der \"Wirkung\" eben nur als reiner Begriffe bedienen, das\nheisst als conventioneller Fiktionen zum Zweck der Bezeichnung, der\nVerständigung, nicht der Erklärung. Im \"An-sich\" giebt es nichts\nvon \"Causal-Verbänden\", von \"Nothwendigkeit\", von \"psychologischer\nUnfreiheit\", da folgt nicht \"die Wirkung auf die Ursache\", das regiert\nkein \"Gesetz\". Wir sind es, die allein die Ursachen, das Nacheinander,\ndas Für-einander, die Relativität, den Zwang, die Zahl, das Gesetz,\ndie Freiheit, den Grund, den Zweck erdichtet haben; und wenn wir diese\nZeichen-Welt als \"an sich\" in die Dinge hineindichten, hineinmischen,\nso treiben wir es noch einmal, wie wir es immer getrieben haben,\nnämhch mythologisch. Der \"unfreie Wille\" ist Mythologie: im\nwirkhchen Leben handelt es sich nur um starken und schwachen Willen.\n- Es ist fast immer schon ein Symptom davon, wo es bei ihm selber\nmangelt, wenn ein Denker bereits in aller \"Causal-Verknüpfung\" und\n\"psychologischer Nothwendigkeit\" etwas von Zwang, Noth, Folgen-Müssen,\nDruck, Unfreiheit herausfühlt: es ist verrätherisch, gerade so zu\nfühlen, - die Person verräth sich. Und überhaupt wird, wenn ich recht\nbeobachtet habe, von zwei ganz entgegengesetzten Seiten aus, aber\nimmer auf eine tief persönhche Weise die \"Unfreiheit des Willens\"\nals Problem gefasst: die Einen wollen um keinen Preis ihre\n\"Verantworthchkeit\", den Glauben an sich, das persönhche Anrecht auf\nihr Verdienst fahren lassen (die eitlen Rassen gehören dahin -); die\nAnderen wollen umgekehrt nichts verantworten, an nichts schuld sein\nund verlangen, aus einer innerhchen Selbst-Verachtung heraus, sich\nselbst irgend wohin abwälzen zu können. Diese Letzteren pflegen sich,\nwenn sie Bücher schreiben, heute der Verbrecher anzunehmen; eine Art\nvon sociahstischem Mitleiden ist ihre gefälhgste Verkleidung. Und\nin der That, der Fatahsmus der Willensschwachen verschönert sich\nerstaunhch, wenn er sich als \"la religion de la souffrance humaine\"\neinzuführen versteht: es ist sein \"guter Geschmack\".",
    "Kaufmann": "The causa sui is the best self-contradiction that has been \nconceived so far, it is a sort of rape and perversion of logic; but the \nextravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with just this nonsense. The desire for “free~ \ndom of the will” in the superlative metaphysical sense, which still \nholds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated; the \ndesire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one’s actions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, \nand society involves nothing less than to be precisely this causa sui \nand, with more than Münchhausen’s audacity, to pull oneself up \ninto existence by the hair, out of the swamps of nothingness.** Sup23 Cf. Sartre's famous dictum: “If man as the existentiahst sees him is not \ndefinable, it is because to begin with he is nothing. He will not be anything \nuntil later, and then he will be what he makes of himself. . . . Man simply \nis. Not that he is simply what he conceives himself to be, but he is what he \nwills . . . Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself, That \nis the first principle of existentiahsm. . . . Before that projection of the \nself nothing exists . .. Man is responsible for what he is. Thus, the first \neffect of existentiahsm is that it puts every man in possession of himself as \nhe is, and places the entire responsibility for his existence squarely upon his \nown shoulders” (“Existentiahsm Is a Humanism,” included in Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre, ed. Walter Kaufmann, pp. 290f.). \nReading this without knowing that Beyond Good and Evil was published \nin 1886 and Sartre's lecture in 1946, one would scarcely guess at Nietzsche's \nimmense influence on existentiahsm in general and Sartre in particular; one \nmight even suppose that Nietzsche was here polemicizing against Sartre, Cf, \nalso section 8 of “The Four Great Errors” in Twilight of the Idols (Portable Nietzsche, p. 500), where some imphcations of the above passage in \nBeyond Good and Evil are developed briefly, \nON THE PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS 29 \npose someone were thus to see through the boorish simplicity of this \ncelebrated concept of “free will” and put it out of his head altogether, I beg of him to carry his “enlightenment” a step further, and \nalso put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception \nof “free will”: I mean “unfree will,” which amounts to a misuse of \ncause and effect. One should not wrongly reify “cause” and “effect,” as the natural scientists do (and whoever, hke them, now \n“naturahzes” in his thinking), according to the prevaihng mechanical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until it “effects” its end; one should use “cause” and “effect” only as pure concepts, that is to say, as conventional fictions for the purpose of \ndesignation and communication—not for explanation. In the “initself” there is nothing of “causal connections,” of “necessity,” or of \n“psychological non-freedom”; there the effect does not follow the \ncause, there is no rule of “law.” It is we alone who have devised \ncause, sequence, for-each-other, relativity, constraint, number, \nlaw, freedom, motive, and purpose; and when we project and mix \nthis symbol world into things as if it existed “in itself,” we act \nonce more as we have always acted—mythologically. The “unfree \nwill” is mythology; in real life it is only a matter of strong and weak \nwills. \nIt is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself \nwhen a thinker senses in every “causal connection” and “psychological necessity” something of constraint, need, compulsion to \nobey, pressure, and unfreedom; it is suspicious to have such feehngs \n—the person betrays himself. And in general, if I have observed \ncorrectly, the “unfreedom of the will” is regarded as a problem \nfrom two entirely opposite standpoints, but always in a profoundly \npersonal manner: some will not give up their “responsibility,” their \nbelief in themselves, the personal right to their merits at any price \n(the vain races belong to this class). Others, on the contrary, do not \nwish to be answerable for anything, or blamed for anything, and \nowing to an inward self-contempt, seek to lay the blame for themselves somewhere else. The latter, when they write books, are in \nthe habit today of taking the side of criminals; a sort of sociahst pity \nis their most attractive disguise. And as a matter of fact, the fatal30 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nism of the weak-willed embelhshes itself surprisingly when it can \npose as “la religion de la souffrance humaine”;?4 that is its “good \ntaste,”",
    "Hollingdale": "The causa sui is the best self-contradiction hitherto imagined, a kind of logical rape \nand unnaturalness: but mankind's extravagant pride has managed to get itself deeply \nand frightfully entangled with precisely this piece of nonsense. For the desire for \n‘freedom of will’ in that metaphysical superlative sense which is unfortunately still \ndominant in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the whole and sole \nresponsibility for one's actions and to absolve God, world, ancestors, chance, society \nfrom responsibility for them, is nothing less than the desire to be precisely that \ncausa sui and, with more than Miinchhausen temerity, to pull oneself into existence \nout of the swamp of nothingness by one's own hair. Assuming it is possible in this \nway to get beyond the peasant simplicity of this celebrated concept ‘free will’ and \nbanish it from one's mind, I would then ask whoever does that to carry his \n‘enlightenment’ a step further and also banish from his mind the contrary of that \nunnatural concept ‘free will’: I mean ‘unfree will’, which amounts to an abuse of \ncause and effect. One ought not to make ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ into material things, as \nnatural scientists do (and those who, hke them, naturahze in their thinking — ), in \naccordance with the prevaihng mechanistic stupidity which has the cause press and \npush until it ‘produces an effect’; one ought to employ ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ only as \npure concepts, that is to say as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation, \nmutual understanding, not explanation. In the ‘in itself’ there is nothing of ‘causal \nconnection’, of ‘necessity’, of ‘psychological unfreedom’; there ‘the effect’ does not \n‘follow the cause’, there no ‘law’ rules. It is we alone who have fabricated causes, \nsuccession, reciprocity, relativity, compulsion, number, law, freedom, motive, \npurpose; and when we falsely introduce this world of symbols into things and \nmingle it with them as though this symbol-world were an ‘in itself’, we once more \nbehave as we have always behaved, namely mythologically. ‘Unfree will’ is \n\n\nmythology: in real life it is only a question of strong and weak wills. — It is almost \nalways a symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker detects in every \n‘causal connection’ and ‘psychological necessity’ something of compulsion, \nexigency, constraint, pressure, unfreedom: such feehngs are traitors, the person who \nhas them gives himself away. And, if I have observed correctly, ‘unfreedom of will’ \nis in general conceived as a problem from two completely antithetical standpoints \nbut always in a profoundly personal manner: one will at no price give up his \n‘responsibility’, his belief in himself, the personal right to his deserts (the vain ra\nbelong here — ), the other, on the contrary, will not be responsible for anything, to \nblame for anything, and out of an inner self-contempt wants to be able to shift off \nhis responsibility for himself somewhere else. This latter, when he writes books, \ntends today to espouse the cause of the criminal; his most pleasing disguise is a kind \nof sociahst sympathy. And the fatahsm of the weak-willed is indeed beautified to an \nastonishing degree when it can present itself as ‘la religion de la souffrance \nhumaine’: that is its ‘good taste’.",
