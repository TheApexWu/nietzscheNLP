    "Gutenberg": "Niemand wird so leicht eine Lehre, bloss weil sie glückhch macht,\noder tugendhaft macht, deshalb für wahr halten: die hebhchen\n\"Ideahsten\" etwa ausgenommen, welche für das Gute, Wahre, Schöne\nschwärmen und in ihrem Teiche alle Arten von bunten plumpen und\ngutmüthigen Wünschbarkeiten durcheinander schwimmen lassen. Glück\nund Tugend sind keine Argumente. Man vergisst aber geme, auch auf\nSeiten besonnener Geister, dass Unglückhch-machen und Böse-machen\nebensowenig Gegenargumente sind. Etwas dürfte wahr sein: ob es gleich\nim höchsten Grade schädhch und gefährhch wäre; ja es könnte selbst\nzur Grundbeschaffenheit des Daseins gehören, dass man an seiner\nvölhgen Erkenntniss zu Grunde gienge, - so dass sich die Stärke eines\nGeistes damach bemässe, wie viel er von der \"Wahrheit\" gerade noch\naushielte, deuthcher, bis zu welchem Grade er sie verdünnt, verhüllt,\nversüsst, verdumpft, verfälscht nöthig hätte. Aber keinem Zweifel\nunterhegt es, dass für die Entdeckung gewisser Theile der Wahrheit\ndie Bösen und Unglückhchen begünstigter sind und eine grössere\n\nWahrscheinhchkeit des Gehngens haben; nicht zu reden von den\nBösen, die glückhch sind, - eine Species, welche von den Morahsten\nverschwiegen wird. Vielleicht, dass Härte und List günstigere\nBedingungen zur Entstehung des starken, unabhängigen Geistes und\nPhilosophen abgeben, als jene sanfte feine nachgebende Gutartigkeit\nund Kunst des Leicht-nehmens, welche man an einem Gelehrten schätzt\nund mit Recht schätzt. Vorausgesetzt, was voran steht, dass man den\nBegriff \"Philosoph\" nicht auf den Philosophen einengt, der Bücher\nschreibt - oder gar seine Philosophie in Bücher bringt! - Einen\nletzten Zug zum Bilde des freigeisterischen Philosophen bringt\nStendhal bei, den ich um des deutschen Geschmacks willen nicht\nunterlassen will zu unterstreichen: - denn er geht wider den deutschen\nGeschmack. \"Pour être bon philosophe\", sagt dieser letzte grosse\nPsycholog, \"il faut être sec, clair, sans illusion. Un banquier,\nqui a fait fortune, a une partie du caractère requis pour faire des\ndécouvertes en philosophie, c'est-'á-dire pour voir clair dans ce qui\nest.\"",
    "Kaufmann": "Nobody is very hkely to consider a doctrine true merely because it makes people happy or virtuous—except perhaps the \nlovely “ideahsts” who become effusive about the good, the true, \nand the beautiful and allow all kinds of motley, clumsy, and benevolent desiderata to swim around in utter confusion in their pond. \nHappiness and virtue are no arguments. But people hke to forget— \neven sober spirits—that making unhappy and evil are no counterarguments, Something might be true while being harmful and dangerous in the highest degree. Indeed, it might be a basic characteristic of existence that those who would know it completely would \nperish, in which case the strength of a spirit should be measured according to how much of the “truth” one could still barely endure— \nor to put it more clearly, to what degree one would require it to be \nthinned down, shrouded, sweetened, blunted, falsified.2® \nBut there is no doubt at all that the evil and unhappy are more \nfavored when it comes to the discovery of certain parts of truth, \n10 This is relevant to Nietzsche's conception of an order of rank and the \nthemes of Part IX below, \n50 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nand that the probability of their success here is greater—not to \nspeak of the evil who are happy, a species the morahsts bury in \nsilence. Perhaps hardness and cunning fumish more favorable \nconditions for the origin of the strong, independent spirit and philosopher than that gentle, fine, concihatory good-naturedness and \n\n\nart of taking things lightly which people prize, and prize rightly, in \na scholar. Assuming first of all that the concept “philosopher” is not \nrestricted to the philosopher who writes books—or makes books of \nhis philosophy. \nA final trait for the image of the free-spirited philosopher is \ncontributed by Stendhal whom, considering German taste, I do \nnot want to fail to stress—for he goes against the German taste. \n“Pour étre bon philosophe,” says this last great psychologist, “il \nfaut éire sec, clair, sans illusion. Un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a \nune partie du caracıere requis pour faire des découvertes en philosophie, c'est-à-dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est.” 2",
    "Hollingdale": "No one is hkely to consider a doctrine true merely because it makes happy or makes \nvirtuous: excepting perhaps the dear ‘ideahsts’, who rapturize over the good, the \ntrue and the beautiful and let all kinds of colourful, clumsy and good-natured \ndesiderata swim about together in their pond. Happiness and virtue are no \narguments. But even thoughtful spirits hke to forget that making unhappy and \nmaking evil are just as httle counter-arguments. Something might be true although \nat the same time harmful and dangerous in the highest degree; indeed, it could \npertain to the fundamental nature of existence that a complete knowledge of it \nwould destroy one — so that the strength of a spirit could be measured by how much \n‘truth’ it could take, more clearly, to what degree it needed it attenuated, veiled, \nsweetened, blunted, and falsified. But there can be no doubt that for the discovery \nof certain parts of truth the wicked and unhappy are in a more favourable position \nand are more hkely to succeed; not to speak of the wicked who are happy — a \nspecies about whom the morahsts are silent. Perhaps severity and cunning provide \nmore favourable conditions for the formation of the strong, independent spirit and \nphilosopher than does that gentle, sweet, yielding good-naturedness and art of \ntaking things lightly which is prized in a scholar and rightly prized. Supposing in \nadvance that the concept ‘philosopher is not limited to the philosopher who writes \nbooks — or, worse, writes books of his philosophy! — A final trait in the image of the \nfree-spirited philosopher is provided by Stendhal, and in view of what German taste \nis I do not want to fail to emphasize it — for it goes against German taste. ‘Pour être\nbon philosophe’, said this last great psychologist, il faut être sec, clair, sans illus\nUn banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une partie du caractère requis pour faire des \ndécouvertes en philosophie, c'est-à-dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est.’",
    "Norman": "No one would consider a doctrine to be true just because it makes people \nhappy or virtuous, with the possible exception of the darhng “Ideahsts,” \nwho wax enthusiastic over the Good, the True, and the Beautiful, and let \nall sorts of colorful, clumsy, and good-natured desiderata swim through \ntheir pond in utter confusion. Happiness and virtue are not arguments. \nBut we hke to forget (even thoughtful spirits hke to forget) that being made \nunhappy and evil are not counter-arguments either. Something could be \ntrue even if it is harmful and dangerous to the highest degree. It could \neven be part of the fundamental character of existence that people with \ncomplete knowledge get destroyed, — so that the strength ofa spirit would \nbe proportionate to how much of the “truth” he could withstand — or, to \nput it more clearly, to what extent he needs it to be thinned out, veiled \nover, sweetened up, dumbed down, and hed about. But there is no doubt \nthat when it comes to discovering certain aspects of the truth, people who \nare evil and unhappy are more fortunate and have a greater probability \nof success (not to mention those who are both evil and happy — a species \nthat the morahsts don’t discuss). Perhaps harshness and cunning provide \nmore favorable conditions for the origin of the strong, independent spirit \nand philosopher than that gentle, fine, yielding good nature and art of \ntaking things lightly that people value, and value rightly, in a scholar. \nAssuming first of all that we do not limit our notion of the “philosopher” \nto the philosophers who write books — or put their own philosophy into \nbooks! — One last feature for the picture of the free-spirited philosopher",
    "Faber": "No one will very easily hold a doctrine to be true merely because \nit makes us happy or virtuous, with the possible exception of those \ndear ‘ideahsts’ who rhapsodize about goodness, truth, beauty, and \nlet all sorts of eye-catching, obvious, and good-natured wishful \nthoughts swim around together in their pond. Happiness and virtue \ncannot be used as arguments. But we hke to forget, even the \nthoughtful spirits among us, that whatever makes us unhappy or \nevil can no more be used as a counter-argument. Something might \nbe true, even if it were also harmful and dangerous in the highest \ndegree; indeed, it might be part of the essential nature of existence \nthat to understand it completely would lead to our own destruction. \nThe strength of a person’s spirit would then be measured by how \nmuch ‘truth’ he could tolerate, or more precisely, to what extent \nhe needs to have it diluted, disguised, sweetened, muted, falsified. \nBut there can be no doubt that wicked and unhappy people are \nbetter suited to discover certain parts of the truth and are more \nhkely to be successful; not to mention the wicked people who are \nhappy—a species that the morahsts have kept silent about. Perhaps \nharshness and cunning fumish conditions more favourable for the \ndevelopment of strong, independent spirits and philosophers than \ndo that gentle, refined, accommodating good nature and skill in \ntaking things lightly which we prize in scholars, and with good \nreason. Assuming, of course, that we are not restricting the concept \n38 Beyond Good and Evil \n\n\nof ‘philosopher’ to the philosopher who writes books—or even sets \nforth Ais philosophy in books! \nWe leam of one last trait in the portrait of the free-spirited \nphilosopher from Stendhal,* one which I must insist on underhning \nfor the sake of German taste, because it goes against German taste. \n‘Pour étre bon philosophe, this last great psychologist tells us, ‘il \nfaut ¢tre sec, clair, sans illusion.

    "Zimmern": "Nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely \nbecause it makes people happy or virtuous — excepting, perhaps, the amiable \"Ideahsts,\" who are enthusiastic about \nthe good, true, and beautiful, and let all kinds of motley, \ncoarse, and good-natured desirabihties swim about promiscuously in their pond. Happiness and virtue are no arguments. It is wilhngly forgotten, however, even on the part \nof thoughtful minds, that to make unhappy £ind to make \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 45 \nbad are just as httle counter-arguments. A thing could be \ntrue, although it were in the highest degree injurious and \ndangerous; indeed, the fundamental constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full knowledge \nof it — so that the strength of a mind might be measured by \nthe amount of \"truth\" it could endure — or to speak more \n\n\nplainly, by the extent to which it required truth attenuated, \nveiled, sweetened, damped, and falsified. But there is no \ndoubt that for the discovery of certain portions of truth the \nwicked and unfortunate are more favourably situated and \nhave a greater hkehhood of success; not to spezik of the \nwicked who are happy — a species about whom morahsts \nare silent. Perhaps severity and craft are more favourable \nconditions for the development of strong, independent spirits \nand philosophers than the gentle, refined, yielding goodnature, and habit of taking things easily, which are prized, \nand rightly prized in a leamed man. Presupposing always, \nto begin with, that the term \"philosopher\" be not confined \nto the philosopher who writes books, or even introduces his \nphilosophy into books! — Stendhal fumishes a last feature of \nthe portrait of the free-spirited philosopher, which for the \nsake of German taste I will not omit to underhne — for it is \nopposed to German taste. \"Pour etre bon philosophe,\" \nsays this last great psychologist, \"il jaut etre sec, clair, sans \nillusion. Un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une partie du \ncaractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie, \nc'est-d-dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est.\" \nj^ Everything that is profound loves the mask: the proj foundest things have a hatred even of figure and hkeness. \nShould not the contrary only be the right disguise for the \n46 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nshame of a God to go about in? A question worth asking! — \nit would be strange if some mystic has not already ventured \non the same kind of thing. There are proceedings of such \na dehcate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with \ncoarseness and make them unrecognisable; there are actions of love and of an extravagant magnanimity after \nwhich nothing can be wiser than to take a stick and thrash \nthe witness soundly: one thereby obscures his recollection. \nMany a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory, \nin order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the \nsecret: shame is inventive. They are not the worst things \nof which one is most ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask — there is so much goodness in craft. I could \nimagine that a man with something costly and fragile to \nconceal, would roll through life clumsily and rotundly hke \nan old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of \nhis shame requiring it to be so. A man who has depths in \nhis shame meets his destiny and his dehcate decisions upon \npaths which few ever reach, and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate friends may \nbe ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from their eyes, \nand equally so his regained security. Such a hidden nature, \nwhich instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment, and is inexhaustible in evasion of communication, desires and insists that a mask of himself shall occupy his \nplace in the hearts and heads of his friends; and supposing \nhe does not desire it, his eyes will some day be opened to \nthe fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him there — and \nthat it is well to be so. Every profound spirit needs a mask; \nnay, more, around every profound spirit there continually \ngrows a mask, owing to the constantly false, that is to say, \nsuperficial interpretation of every word he utters, every step \nhe takes, every sign of life he manifests. \nII \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 47"
