Die ebenso steife als sittsame Tartüfferie\ndes alten Kant, mit der er uns auf die dialektischen Schleichwege\nlockt, welche zu seinem \"kategorischen Imperativ\" führen, richtiger\nverführen - dies Schauspiel macht uns Verwöhnte lächeln, die wir keine\nkleine Belustigung darin finden, den feinen Tücken alter Morahsten\nund Moralprediger auf die Finger zu sehn. Oder gar jener Hocuspocus\nvon mathematischer Form, mit der Spinoza seine Philosophie - \"die\nLiebe zu seiner Weisheit\" zuletzt, das Wort richtig und bilhg\nausgelegt - wie in Erz panzerte und maskirte, um damit von\nvomherein den Muth des Angreifenden einzuschüchtem, der auf diese\nunüberwindhche Jungfrau und Pallas Athene den Bhck zu werfen wagen\nwürde: - wie viel eigne Schüchtemheit und Angreifbarkeit verräth\ndiese Maskerade eines einsiedlerischen Kranken!",
        "Kaufmann": "What provokes one to look at all philosophers half suspiciously, half mockingly, is not that one discovers again and again \nhow innocent they are—how often and how easily they make mistakes and go astray; in short, their childishness and childhkeness— \nbut that they are not honest enough in their work, although they all \nmake a lot of virtuous noise when the problem of truthfulness is \ntouched even remotely. They all pose as if they had discovered and \nreached their real opinions through the self-development of a \n\n\ncold, pure, divinely unconcemed dialectic (as opposed to the mystics of every rank, who are more honest and doltish—and talk of \n“inspiration”); while at bottom it is an assumption, a hunch, indeed a kind of “inspiration”—most often a desire of the heart that \nhas been filtered and made abstract—that they defend with reasons they have sought after the fact. They are all advocates who resent that name, and for the most part even wily spokesmen for \n®One of Kant's central questions was, “How are synthetic judgments a \nriori possible?\" He meant judgments that are known for certain to be true. \nindependently of experience. but not by definition. His examples include the \njudgment that every event has a cause. Hans Vaihinger, a leading Kant \nscholar who published a book on Nietzsche als Philosoph (1902; 4th ed. \n1916), later published his own theory of necessary fictions under the title, \nDie Philosophie des Als-Ob (1911; English tr. by C. K. Ogden, 1924: The \nPhilosophy of “As If”), devoting the final chapter to a detailed discussion \nof Nietzsche's similar ideas. Cf. section 11 below, \nON THE PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS 13 \ntheir prejudices which they baptize “truths”—and very far from having the courage of the conscience that admits this, precisely this, to \nitself; very far from having the good taste of the courage which also \nlets this be known, whether to wam an enemy or friend, or, from \nexuberance, to mock itself, \nThe equally stiff and decorous Tartuffery of the old Kant as \nhe lures us on the dialectical bypaths that lead to his “categorical \nimperative”—really lead astray and seduce—this spectacle makes \nus smile, as we are fastidious and find it quite amusing to watch \nclosely the subtle tricks of old morahsts and preachers of morals. \nOr consider the hocus-pocus of mathematical form with which \nSpinoza clad his philosophy—really “the love of his wisdom,” to \nrender that word fairly and squarely—in mail and mask, to strike \nterror at the very outset into the heart of any assailant who should \ndare to glance at that invincible maiden and Pallas Athena: how \nmuch personal timidity and vulnerabihty this masquerade of a sick \nhermit betrays!",
        "Hollingdale": "What makes one regard philosophers half mistrustfully and half mockingly is not \nthat one again and again detects how innocent they are — how often and how easily \nthey fall into error and go astray, in short their childishness and childhkeness — but\nthat they display altogether insufficient honesty, while making a mighty and virtuous \nnoise as soon as the problem of truthfulness is even remotely touched on. They pose \nas having discovered and attained their real opinions through the self-evolution of a \ncold, pure, divinely unperturbed dialectic (in contrast to the mystics of every rank, \nwho are more honest and more stupid than they — these speak of ‘inspiration’): while \nwhat happens at bottom is that a prejudice, a notion, an ‘inspiration’, generally a \n\n\ndesire of the heart sifted and made abstract, is defended by them with reasons \nsought after the event — they are one and all advocates who do not want to be \nregarded as such, and for the most part no better than cunning pleaders for their \nprejudices, which they baptize ‘truths’ — and very far from possessing the courage of \nthe conscience which admits this fact to itself, very far from possessing the good \ntaste of the courage which publishes this fact, whether to wam a foe or a friend or \nout of high spirits and in order to mock itself. The tartuffery, as stiff as it is \nvirtuous, of old Kant as he lures us along the dialectical bypaths which lead, more \ncorrectly, mislead, to his ‘categorical imperative’ — this spectacle makes us smile, we\nwho are fastidious and find no httle amusement in observing the subtle tricks of old \nmorahsts and moral-preachers. Not to speak of that hocus-pocus of mathematical \nform in which, as if in iron, Spinoza encased and masked his philosophy — ‘the love \nof his wisdom’, to render that word fairly and squarely — so as to strike terror into \nthe heart of any assailant who should dare to glance at that invincible maiden and \nPallas Athene — how much personal timidity and vulnerabihty this masquerade of a \nsick recluse betrays!",
        "Norman": "such things are fools — at best. Things of the highest value must have \nanother, separate origin of their own, — they cannot be derived from this \nephemeral, seductive, deceptive, lowly world, from this mad chaos of confusion and desire. Look instead to the lap of being, the everlasting, the \nhidden God, the ‘thing-in-itself’ — this is where their ground must be, and \nnowhere else!”* — This way of judging typifies the prejudices by which \nmetaphysicians of all ages can be recognized: this type of valuation hes behind all their logical procedures. From these “beliefs” they try to acquire \ntheir “knowledge,” to acquire something that will end up being solemnly \nchristened as “the truth.” The fundamental belief of metaphysicians is \nthe belief in oppositions of values. It has not occurred to even the most \ncautious of them to start doubting right here at the threshold, where it is \nactually needed the most — even though they had vowed to themselves “de \n\n\nomnibus dubitandum.”* But we can doubt, first, whether opposites even \nexist and, second, whether the popular valuations and value oppositions \nthat have eamed the metaphysicians’ seal of approval might not only be \nforeground appraisals. Perhaps they are merely provisional perspectives, \nperhaps they are not even viewed head-on; perhaps they are even viewed \nfrom below, hke a frog-perspective, to borrow an expression that painters \nwill recognize. Whatever value might be attributed to truth, truthfulness, \nand selflessness, it could be possible that appearance, the will to deception, \nand craven self-interest should be accorded a higher and more fundamental value for all life. It could even be possible that whatever gives value \nto those good and honorable things has an incriminating hnk, bond, or \ntie to the very things that look hke their evil opposites; perhaps they are \neven essentially the same. Perhaps! — But who is wilhng to take charge \nof such a dangerous Perhaps! For this we must await the arrival of a new \nbreed of philosophers, ones whose taste and inchnation are somehow the \nreverse of those we have seen so far — philosophers of the dangerous Perhaps in every sense. — And in all seriousness: I see these new philosophers \napproaching.",
        "Faber": "What provokes us to look at all philosophers with a mixture of \ndistrust and contempt is not that we are always uncovering how \nguileless they arc—how often and easily they lose their grasp or \ntheir way, in short how childish and childhke they are. It is rather \nthat they are not honest enough, however loud and virtuous a \nracket they all make as soon as the problem of truthfulness is \ntouched upon, even from afar. For they act as if they had discovered \nand acquired what are actually their opinions through the independent unravelhng of a cold, pure, divinely unhampered dialectic \n(whereas mystics of every order, who are more honest, and more \nfoolish, speak of ‘inspiration’); basically, however, they are using \nreasons sought after the fact to defend a pre-existing tenet, a sudden \nidea, a ‘brainstorm’, or, in most cases, a rarefied and abstract version \nof their heart’s desire. They are all of them advocates who refuse \nthe name, that ts in most cases wily spokesmen for their prejudices, \nwhich they dub ‘truths’; and they are very far from having a \nconscience brave enough to own up to it, very far from having the \ngood taste to announce it bravely, whether to wam a foe or a friend, \n\n\nor simply from high spirits and self-mockery. We have to smile at \nthe spectacle of old Kant’s hypocrisy,* as rigid as it is chaste, as he \nlures us onto the dialectical backroads that lead (or better, mislead) \nus to his ‘categorical imperative’,* for we are fastidious and take \nno small amusement in monitoring the subtle wiles of old morahsts \nand moral preachers. Or take that hocus-pocus of mathematical \nform in which Spinoza armoured and disguised his philosophy \n(‘the love of Ais wisdom’* ultimately, if we interpret the word \ncorrectly and fairly), to intimidate at the outset any brave assailant \nwho might dare to throw a glance at this invincible virgin and \nPallas Athena—how this sickly hermit’s masquerade betrays his \nown timidity and assailabihty!",
