    "Gutenberg": "An einer Theorie ist wahrhaftig nicht ihr geringster Reiz, dass sie\nwiderlegbar ist: gerade damit zieht sie feinere Köpfe an. Es scheint,\ndass die hundertfach widerlegte Theorie vom \"freien Willen\" ihre\nFortdauer nur noch diesem Reize verdankt -: immer wieder kommt jemand\nund fühlt sich stark genug, sie zu widerlegen.",
    "Kaufmann": "It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts subtler minds. It seems \n\n\nON THE PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS 25 \nthat the hundred-times-refuted theory of a “free will” owes its persistence to this charm alone; again and again someone comes along \nwho feels he is strong enough to refute it,",
    "Hollingdale": "It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable: it is with precis\nthis charm that it entices subtler minds. It seems that the hundred times refuted \ntheory of ‘free will’ owes its continued existence to this charm alone — : again and \nagain there comes along someone who feels he is strong enough to refute it.",
    "Norman": "That a theory is refutable is, frankly, not the least of its charms: this \n\n\nis precisely how it attracts the more refined intellects. The theory of \n\"free will,\" which has been refuted a hundred times, appears to owe its \nendurance to this charm alone — somebody will always come along and \nfeel strong enough to refute it. \nI9 \nPhilosophers tend to talk about the will as 1f it were the most famihar \nthing in the world. In fact, Schopenhauer would have us believe that the \nwill is the only thing that is really famihar, famihar through and through, \nfamihar without pluses or minuses. But I have always thought that, here \ntoo, Schopenhauer was only doing what philosophers always tend to do: \nadopting and exaggerating a popular prejudice. Wilhng strikes me as, above \nall, something complicated, something unified only in a word — and this \nsingle word contains the popular prejudice that has overruled whatever \nminimal precautions philosophers might take. So let us be more cautious, \nfor once — let us be “unphilosophical.” Let us say: in every act of wilhng \nthere is, to begin with, a plurahty of feehngs, namely: the feehng of the \nstate away from which, the feehng of the state towards which, and the feehng \nof this “away from” and “towards” themselves. But this is accompanied \nby a feehng of the muscles that comes into play through a sort of habit \nas soon as we “will,” even without our putting “arms and legs” into \nmotion. Just as feehng — and indeed many feehngs — must be recognized \nas ingredients of the will, thought must be as well. In every act of will \nthere is a commandeering thought, — and we really should not believe \nthis thought can be divorced from the “wilhng,” as if some will would \nthen be left over! Third, the will is not just a complex of feehng and",
    "Faber": "‘lruly, a theory is charming not least because it is refutable: that is \njust what attracts the better minds to it. It would seem that the \ntheory of ‘free will’, which has been refuted a hundred times over, \nowes its endurance to this charm alone—someone is always coming \nalong and feehng strong enough to refute it.",
    "Zimmern": "It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is \nrefutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL i^ \nsubtle minds. It seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory \nof the \"free will\" owes its persistence to this charm alone; \nsome one is always app)earing who feels himself strong enoughto refute it."
