    "Gutenberg": "Unsre höchsten Einsichten müssen - und sollen! - wie Thorheiten, unter\nUmständen wie Verbrechen khngen, wenn sie unerlaubter Weise Denen zu\nOhren kommen, welche nicht dafür geartet und vorbestimmt sind. Das\nExoterische und das Esoterische, wie man ehedem unter Philosophen\nunterschied, bei Indem, wie bei Griechen, Persem und Muselmännem,\nkurz überall, wo man eine Rangordnung und nicht an Gleichheit und\ngleiche Rechte glaubte, - das hebt sich nicht sowohl dadurch von\neinander ab, dass der Exoteriker draussen steht und von aussen\nher, nicht von innen her, sieht, schätzt, misst, urtheilt: das\nWesenthchere ist, dass er von Unten hinauf die Dinge sieht, - der\nEsoteriker aber von Oben herab! Es giebt Höhen der Seele, von wo aus\ngesehen selbst die Tragödie aufhört, tragisch zu wirken; und, alles\nWeh der Welt in Eins genommen, wer dürfte zu entscheiden wagen, ob\nsein Anbhck nothwendig gerade zum Mitleiden und dergestalt zur\nVerdoppelung des Wehs verführen und zwingen werde?... Was der höheren\nArt von Menschen zur Nahrung oder zur Labsal dient, muss einer sehr\nunterschiedhchen und geringeren Art beinahe Gift sein. Die Tugenden\ndes gemeinen Manns würden vielleicht an einem Philosophen Laster und\nSchwächen bedeuten; es wäre möghch, dass ein hochgearteter Mensch,\ngesetzt, dass er entartete und zu Grunde gienge, erst dadurch in den\nBesitz von Eigenschaften käme, derentwegen man nöthig hätte, ihn in\n\nder niederen Welt, in welche er hinab sank, nunmehr wie einen Heihgen\nzu verehren. Es giebt Bücher, welche für Seele und Gesundheit einen\numgekehrten Werth haben, je nachdem die niedere Seele, die niedrigere\nLebenskraft oder aber die höhere und gewaltigere sich ihrer bedienen:\nim ersten Falle sind es gefährhche, anbröckelnde, auflösende Bücher,\nim anderen Heroldsrufe, welche die Tapfersten zu ihrer Tapferkeit\nherausfordem. Allerwelts-Bücher sind immer übelriechende Bücher: der\nKleine-Leute-Geruch klebt daran. Wo das Volk isst und trinkt, selbst\nwo es verehrt, da pflegt es zu stinken. Man soll nicht in Kirchen\ngehn, wenn man reine Luft athmen will. - -",
    "Kaufmann": "Our highest insights must—and should—sound hke folhes \nand sometimes hke crimes when they are heard without permission by those who are not predisposed and predestined for them.” \nThe difference between the exoteric and the esoteric, formerly \nknown to philosophers—among the Indians as among the Greeks, \nPersians, and Mushms, in short, wherever one believed in an order of rank and not in equality and equal rights—does not so \nmuch consist in this, that the exoteric approach comes from outside \nand sees, estimates, measures, and judges from the outside, not the \ninside: what is much more essential is that the exoteric approach \nsees things from below, the esoteric looks down from above. \nThere are heights of the soul from which even tragedy ceases to \nlook tragic; and rolhng together all the woe of the world—who \ncould dare to decide whether its sight would necessarily seduce us \nand compel us to feel pity and thus double this woe? \nWhat serves the higher type of men as nourishment or delectation must almost be poison for a very different and inferior type. \n\n\nThe virtues of the common man might perhaps signify vices and \nweaknesses in a philosopher. It could be possible that a man of a \nhigh type, when degenerating and perishing, might only at that \npoint acquire quahties that would require those in the lower \nsphere into which he had sunk to begin to venerate him hke a \nsaint. There are books that have opposite values for soul and \nhealth, depending on whether the lower soul, the lower vitahty, or \nthe higher and more vigorous ones tum to them: in the former \ncase, these books are dangerous and lead to crumbhng and disintegration; in the latter, heralds’ cries that call the bravest to their \n16 This theme is taken up again in several later sections, where the concept \nof the mask is discussed; e.g., section 40, \nTHE FREE SPIRIT 43 \ncourage. Books for all the world are always foul-smelhng books: \nthe smell of small people chngs to them. Where the people eat \nand drink, even where they venerate, it usually stinks, One should \nnot go to church if one wants to breathe pure air.",
    "Hollingdale": "Our supreme insights must — and should! — sound hke folhes, in certain cases hke \ncrimes, when they come impermissibly to the ears of those who are not predisposed \nand predestined for them. The exoteric and the esoteric as philosophers formerly \ndistinguished them, among the Indians as among the Greeks, Persians and \nMoslems, in short wherever one believed in an order of rank and not in equality and \nequal rights — differ one from another not so much in that the exoteric stands \noutside and sees, evaluates, measures, judges from the outside, not from the inside: \nwhat is more essential is that this class sees things from below — but the esoteric \nsees them from above! There are heights of the soul seen from which even tragedy \nceases to be tragic; and, taking all the woe of the world together, who could venture \nto assert that the sight of it would have to seduce and compel us to pity and thus to \na doubhng of that woe?... What serves the higher type of man as food or \nrefreshment must to a very different and inferior type be almost poison. The virtues \nof the common man would perhaps indicate vice and weakness in a philosopher; it \n\n\nmay be possible that if a lofty type of man degenerated and perished, he would only \nthus acquire quahties on whose account it would prove necessary in the lower world \ninto which he had sunk henceforth to venerate him as a saint. There are books \nwhich possess an opposite value for soul and health depending on whether the lower \nsoul, the lower vitahty, or the higher and more powerful avails itself of them: in the\nformer case they are dangerous, disintegrative books, which produces dissolution, in \nthe latter they are herald calls challenging the most courageous to their courage. \nBooks for everybody are always malodorous books: the smell of petty people chngs \nto them. Where the people eats and drinks, even where it worships, there is usually \na stink. One should not go into churches if one wants to breathe pure air. —",
    "Norman": "Our highest insights must — and should! — sound hke stupidities, or possibly crimes, when they come without permission to people whose ears have \n9 Little fact.",
    "Faber": "Whenever our loftiest insights inadvertently reach the ears of people \nwho are not constituted or destined to hear them, they must—and \nshould!—sound foolish, or in some circumstances even criminal. \nEarher philosophers (among them Indians as well as Greeks, Persians, and Mushms, people in short who believed in hierarchy and \nnot in equality and equal rights) distinguished what is exoteric from \nwhat is esoteric not only by the fact that the exoteric philosopher \nstands on the outside, and sees, estimates, measures, and makes \njudgements from the outside rather than from the inside: more \nThe Free Spirit 31 \nimportant is that he sees things from down below—whereas the \nesoteric philosopher sees things from above! There are heights of \nthe soul from which vantage point even tragedy ceases to have a \ntragic effect; and taking all the pain of the world together, who \ncould dare decide whether the sight of it should necessarily seduce \nand coerce us to feel pity in particular, thus redoubhng the pain? . . . \nWhat serves to nourish or refresh the higher type of person must \nbe almost poison to a very diverse and inferior type. The virtues \nof the ordinary man might represent vices and weaknesses in a \nphilosopher; it could be that if a higher type of person entered \na state of ruin and degeneration, he would thereby take on characteristics that would thereafter needs cause him to be revered as a \nsaint in that lower world into which he sank. There are books that \nhave an inverse value for body and soul depending on whether they \nare used by the low sort of soul, the lower life force, or the higher \nand more powerful; in the one case they are dangerous, erosive, \ndisintegrative books, in the other they are calls of a herald, challenging those who are most vahant to attain their valour. Books for \nthe masses are always bad-smelhng books: the odour of httle people \nchngs to them. There is usually a stink wherever the common \npeople eat and drink, and even in their places of reverence. Do not \ngo into churches if you want to breathe clean air —",
    "Zimmern": "Our deepest insights must — and should — appear as fol[hes, and under certain circumstances as crimes, when they \njme unauthorisedly to the ears of those who are not dis)sed and predestined for them. The exoteric and the eso[teric, as they were formerly distinguished by philosophers — \nlong the Indians, as among the Greeks, Persians, and Mus36 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nsulmans, in short, wherever people believed in gradations of \nrank and not in equality and equal rights — are not so \nmuch in contradistinction to one another in respect to the \nexoteric class, standing without, and viewing, estimating, \nmeasuring, and judging from the outside, and not from the \ninside; the more essential distinction is that the class in \nquestion views things from below upwards — while the esoteric class views things jrom above downwards. There are \nheights of the soul from which tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically; and if all the woe in the world \nwere taken together, who would dare to decide whether the \nsight of it would necessarily seduce and constrain to sympathy, and thus to a doubhng of the woe? . . . That which \nserves the higher class of men for nourishment or refreshment, must be almost poison to an entirely different and \nlower order of human beings. The virtues of the common \nman would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher; it might be possible for a highly developed man, \nsupposing him to degenerate and go to ruin, to acquire \nquahties thereby alone, for the sake of which he would have \nto be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which he \nhad sunk. There are books which have an inverse value for \nthe soul and the health according as the inferior soul and \nthe lower vitahty, or the higher and more powerful, make \nuse of them. In the former case they are dangerous, disturbing, unsetthng books, in the latter case they are heraldcalls which summon the bravest to their bravery. Books \nfor the general reader are always ill-smelhng books, the \nodour of paltry people chngs to them. Where the populace \neat and drink, and even where they reverence, it is accustomed to stink. One should not go into churches if one \nwishes to breathe pure air. \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 37"
