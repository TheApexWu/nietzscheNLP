    "Gutenberg": "Der Glaube, wie ihn das erste Christenthum verlangt und nicht selten\nerreicht hat, inmitten einer skeptischen und südhch-freigeisterischen\nWelt, die einen Jahrhunderte langen Kampf von Philosophenschulen\nhinter sich und in sich hatte, hinzugerechnet die Erziehung zur\nToleranz, welche das imperium Romanum gab, - dieser Glaube ist nicht\njener treuherzige und bärbeissige Unterthanen-Glaube, mit dem etwa ein\nLuther oder ein Cromwell oder sonst ein nordischer Barbar des Geistes\nan ihrem Gotte und Christenthum gehangen haben; viel eher scholl\njener Glaube Pascal's, der auf schreckhche Weise einem dauemden\nSelbstmorde der Vemunft ähnhch sieht, - einer zähen langlebigen\nwurmhaften Vemunft, die nicht mit Einem Male und Einem Streiche\ntodtzumachen ist. Der christhche Glaube ist von Anbeginn Opferung:\nOpferung aller Freiheit, alles Stolzes, aller Selbstgewissheit\ndes Geistes; zugleich Verknechtung und Selbst-Verhöhnung,\nSelbst-Verstümmelung. Es ist Grausamkeit und rehgiöser Phönicismus\nin diesem Glauben, der einem mürben, vielfachen und viel verwöhnten,\nGewissen zugemuthet wird: seine Voraussetzung ist, dass die\nUnterwerfung des Geistes unbeschreibhch wehe thut, dass die ganze\nVergangenheit und Gewohnheit eines solchen Geistes sich gegen das\nAbsurdissimum wehrt, als welches ihm der \"Glaube\" entgegentritt.\nDie modemen Menschen, mit ihrer Abstumpfung gegen alle christhche\n\nNomenklatur, fühlen das Schauerhch-Superlativische nicht mehr nach,\ndas für einen antiken Geschmack in der Paradoxie der Formel \"Gott am\nKreuze\" lag. Es hat bisher noch niemals und nirgendswo eine gleiche\nKühnheit im Umkehren, etwas gleich Furchtbares, Fragendes und\nFragwürdiges gegeben wie diese Formel: sie verhiess eine Umwerthung\naller antiken Werthe. - Es ist der Orient, der tiefe Orient, es ist\nder orientahsche Sklave, der auf diese Weise an Rom und seiner\nvornehmen und frivolen Toleranz, am römischen \"Kathohcismus\" des\nGlaubens Rache nahm: - und immer war es nicht der Glaube, sondem die\nFreiheit vom Glauben, jene halb stoische und lächelnde Unbekümmertheit\num den Emst des Glaubens, was die Sklaven an ihren Herm, gegen ihre\nHerm empört hat. Die \"Aufklärung\" empört: der Sklave nämhch will\nUnbedingtes, er versteht nur das Tyrannische, auch in der Moral, er\nhebt wie er hasst, ohne Nuance, bis in die Tiefe, bis zum Schmerz,\nbis zur Krankheit, - sein vieles verborgenes Leiden empört sich\ngegen den vornehmen Geschmack, der das Leiden zu leugnen scheint.\nDie Skepsis gegen das Leiden, im Grunde nur eine Attitude der\naristokratischen Moral, ist nicht am wenigsten auch an der Entstehung\ndes letzten grossen Sklaven-Aufstandes betheihgt, welcher mit der\nfranzösischen Revolution begonnen hat.",
    "Kaufmann": "The faith demanded, and not infrequently attained, by original Christianity, in the midst of a skeptical and southem freespirited world that looked back on, and still contained, a centuriesJong fight between philosophical schools, besides the education for \ntolerance given by the imperium Romanum*—this faith is not that \ningenuous and bearhke subaltems’ faith with which, say, a Luther \nor a:Cromwell;or some other northem barbarian of the spirit, clung \nto his.god and to Christianity.

    "Hollingdale": "The faith such as primitive Christianity demanded and not infrequently obtained in \nthe midst of a sceptical and southerly free-spirited world with a centuries-long \nstruggle between philosophical schools behind it and in it, plus the education in \ntolerance provided by the Imperium Romanum -— this faith is not that gruff, truehearted hegeman's faith with which a Luther, say, or a Cromwell, or some other \nnorthem barbarian of the spirit cleaved to his God and his Christianity; it is rather \nthat faith of Pascal which resembles in a terrible fashion a protracted suicide of \nreason — of a tough, long-lived, wormhke reason which is not to be killed \ninstantaneously with a single blow. The Christian faith is from the beginning \nsacrifice: sacrifice of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of the spirit, at t\nsame time enslavement and self-mockery, self-mutilation. There is cruelty and \nreligious Phoenicianism in this faith exacted of an over-ripe, manifold and muchindulged conscience: its presupposition is that the subjection of the spirit is \n\n\nindescribably painful, that the entire past and habitude of such a spirit resists the \nabsurdissimum which ‘faith’ appears to it to be. Modem men, with their obtuseness \nto all Christian nomenclature, no longer sense the gruesome superlative which lay \nfor an antique taste in the paradoxical formula ‘god on the cross’. Never and \nnowhere has there hitherto been a comparable boldness in inversion, anything so \nfearsome, questioning and questionable, as this formula: it promised a revaluation \nof all antique values. — It is the orient, the innermost orient, it is the oriental sla\nwho in this fashion took vengeance on Rome and its noble and frivolous tolerance, \non Roman ‘cathohcism’ of faith — and it has never been faith but always freedom \nfrom faith, that half-stoical and smihng unconcem with the seriousness of faith, that\nhas enraged slaves in their masters and against their masters. ‘Enlightenment’ \nenrages: for the slave wants the unconditional, he understands in the domain of \nmorality too only the tyrannical, he loves as he hates, without nuance, into the \ndepths of him, to the point of pain, to the point of sickness — the great hidden \nsuffering he feels is enraged at the noble taste which seems to deny suffering. \nScepticism towards suffering, at bottom no more than a pose of aristocratic \nmorality, was hkewise not the least contributory cause of the last great slave revolt \nwhich began with the French Revolution.",
    "Norman": "The sort of faith demanded (and often achieved) by early Christianity \nin the middle of a skeptical, southem, free-spirited world, a world that \nhad century-long struggles between schools of philosophy behind and \ninside it, not to mention the education in tolerance given by the imperium \nRomanum? — this faith is not the simple, rude, peon's faith with which a \nLuther or a Cromwell or some other northem barbarian of the spirit clung \nto its God and its Christianity. It is much closer to Pascal’s faith, which has \nthe gruesome appearance ofa protracted suicide of reason — a tough, longlived, worm-hke reason that cannot be killed all at once and with a single \nstroke. From the beginning, Christian faith has been sacrifice: sacrifice of \nall freedom, of all pride, of all self-confidence of the spirit; it is simultaneously enslavement and self-derision, self-mutilation. There is cruelty and \nreligious Phoenicianism in this faith, which is expected of a wom-down, \nmany-sided, badly spoiled conscience. Its presupposition is that the subjugation of spirit causes indescribable pain, and that the entire past and all the \nhabits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum? presented to it as “faith.” \nObtuse to all Christian terminology, modem people can no longer relate \nto the hideous superlative found by an ancient taste in the paradoxical \nformula “god on the cross.” Nowhere to date has there been such a bold \ninversion or anything quite as horrible, questioning, and questionable as \nthis formula. It promised a revaluation of all the values of antiquity. — \nThis was the revenge of the Orient, the deep Orient, this was the revenge \nof the oriental slave on Rome with its noble and frivolous tolerance, on \nRoman “Cathohcity” of faith. And what infuriated the slaves about and \nagainst their masters was never faith itself, but rather the freedom from \nfaith, that half-stoic and smihng nonchalance when it came to the seriousness of faith. Enlightenment is infuriating. Slaves want the unconditional; \n? Roman Empire. \n3 Height of absurdity.",
    "Faber": "‘The faith demanded and often achieved by early Christianity in \nthe midst of the southem world of sceptical free spirits, where \nphilosophical schools had not only battled for centuries but where \nthe Roman empire had also educated men to be tolerant, is zot the \nsame as that naive and quarrelsome underhngs’ faith with which \nLuther, for example, or Cromwell, or any other northem barbarian \nof the spirit clung to their God and their Christianity. Rather, that \ncarly faith is more hke Pascal’s, one that has the horrible aspect of \nan ongoing suicide of reason—a tough, long-lived, wormhke reason \nthat cannot be killed off all at once with one blow. From the \nbeginning, Christian faith has meant a sacrifice: the sacrifice of \nfreedom, pride, spiritual self-confidence; it has meant subjugation \nand self-derision, self-mutilation. There is cruelty and religious \nPhoenicianism* in this faith, which is demanded of a soft, differentiated, and often pampered conscience. This kind of faith assumes \nthat the submission of the spirit is indescribably painful, that the \npast history and habits of this kind of spirit are resistant to \nthe absurdissimum,* in which form ‘faith’ confronts it. Modem \npeople, deadened to all the terms of Christian language, no longer \nhave a feehng for the terrifying superlative, which for the ancient \nsensibility lay in the paradox of the formula ‘God on the cross’. At \nne time or place has there ever been such a daring reversal, a \nformula so frightful, questioning, and questionable as this one: it \nushered in a re-evaluation of all ancient values. \nThus did the Orient, the profound Orient, the Oriental slave \ntake vengeance on Rome, with its noble and frivolous tolerance, \nvengeance on the Roman ‘Cathohcism’ of faith—and it was never \nfaith, but rather the freedom from faith, that half-stoic, smihng \nlack of concem for the seriousness of faith, which enraged the slaves \nabout their masters, set them against their masters. ‘Enlightenment’ \nenrages the slave, for he wants what is unconditional; he understands only what is tyrannical, even in morality; he loves as he \nhates, without nuance, into the very depths, of pain, of disease— \nhis manifold hidden suffering rages against that noble sensibility \nThe Religious Disposition 45 \n\n\nwhich seems to deny suffering. Indeed, scepticism about suffering, \nat bottom only an aristocratic moral pose, played no small role in \nthe origins of the last great slave rebelhon, which began with the \nFrench Revolution.",
    "Zimmern": "Faith, such as early Christianity desired, and not infrequently achieved in the midst of a sceptical and southemly \nfree-spirited world, which had centuries of struggle between \nphilosophical schools behind it and in it, counting besides \nthe education in tolerance which the imperium Romanum \ngave — this faith is not that sincere, austere slave-faith by \nwhich perhaps a Luther or a Cromwell, or some other northem barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his God \nand Christianity; it is much rather the faith of Pascal, which \nxesembles in a terrible manner a continuous suicide of rea— a tough, long-lived, wormhke reason, which is not to \nslain at once and with a single blow. The Christian faith \nfrom the beginning, is sacrifice: the sacrifice of all freedom, \nall pride, all self-confidence of spirit; it is at the same time \nabjection, self -derision, and self-mutilation.
