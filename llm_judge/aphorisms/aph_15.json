    "Gutenberg": "Um Physiologie mit gutem Gewissen zu treiben, muss man darauf\nhalten, dass die Sinnesorgane nicht Erscheinungen sind im Sinne der\nideahstischen Philosophie: als solche könnten sie ja keine Ursachen\nsein! Sensuahsmus mindestens somit als regulative Hypothese, um nicht\nzu sagen als heuristisches Princip. - Wie? und Andere sagen gar, die\nAussenwelt wäre das Werk unsrer Organe? Aber dann wäre ja unser Leib,\nals ein Stück dieser Aussenwelt, das Werk unsrer Organe! Aber dann\nwären ja unsre Organe selbst - das Werk unsrer Organe! Dies ist, wie\nmir scheint, eine gründhche reductio ad absurdum: gesetzt, dass der\nBegriff causa sui etwas gründhch Absurdes ist. Folghch ist die\nAussenwelt nicht das Werk unsrer Organe -?",
    "Kaufmann": "To study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist \nthat the sense organs are not phenomena in the sense of ideahstic \nphilosophy; as such they could not be causes! Sensuahsm, therefore, at least as a regulative hypothesis, if not as a heuristic principle. \n\n\n: What? And others even say that the extemal world is the \nwork of our organs? But then our body, as a part of this extemal \nworld, would be the work of our organs! But then our organs themselves would be—the work of our organs! It seems to me that this is \nON THE FREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS 23 \na complete reductio ad absurdum,!® assuming that the concept of a \ncausa sui is something fundamentally absurd. Consequently, the \nextemal world is not the work of our organs—?",
    "Hollingdale": "If one is to pursue physiology with a good conscience one is compelled to insist that \nthe organs of sense are not phenomena in the sense of ideahst philosophy: for if \nthey were they could not be causes! Sensuahsm therefore is at least a regulative \nhypothesis, certainly a heuristic principle. — What? and others even go so far as to \nsay that the extemal world is the work of our organs? But then our body, as a piece \nof this extemal world, would be the work of our organs! But then our organs \nthemselves would be — the work of our organs! This, it seems to me, is a complete \nreductio ad absurdum, supposing that the concept causa sui is something altogether \nabsurd. Consequently the extemal world is not the work of our organs — ?",

    "Faber": "In order to practise physiology with a good conscience, you have to \nbelieve that the sense organs are not phenomena in the philosophical \nideahst sense, for then they could not be causes! This is sensuahsm \nas a regulative hypothesis at least, if not as an heuristic principle. \nWhat’s that? And other people are actually saying that the \nextemal world is created by our sense organs? But then our body, \nas part of this extemal world, would be the creation of our sense \norgans! But then our very sense organs would be—the creation of \nour sense organs! It seems to me that this is a complete reductio \nad absurdum:* assuming that the concept causa sui* is something \ncompletely absurd. It follows that the outer world is not the creation \nof our sense organs—?",
    "Zimmern": "We keep our Feast of Feasts, sure of our boume, \nOur aims self-same: \nThe Guest of Guests, friend Zarathustra, came! \nThe world now laughs, the grisly veil was tom, \nAnd Light and Dark were one that wedding-mom. \nTHE END"
