In der That, man thut gut (und klug), zur Erklärung\ndavon, wie eigenthch die entlegensten metaphysischen Behauptungen\neines Philosophen zu Stande gekommen sind, sich immer erst zu fragen:\nauf welche Moral will es (will er -) hinaus? Ich glaube demgemäss\nnicht, dass ein \"Trieb zur Erkenntniss\" der Vater der Philosophie ist,\nsondem dass sich ein andrer Trieb, hier wie sonst, der Erkenntniss\n(und der Verkenntniss!) nur wie eines Werkzeugs bedient hat. Wer aber\ndie Grundtriebe des Menschen darauf hin ansieht, wie weit sie gerade\nhier als inspirirende Genien (oder Dämonen und Kobolde -) ihr Spiel\ngetrieben haben mögen, wird finden, dass sie Alle schon einmal\nPhilosophie getrieben haben, - und dass jeder Einzelne von ihnen\ngerade sich gar zu geme als letzten Zweck des Daseins und als\nberechtigten Herm aller übrigen Triebe darstellen möchte. Denn\njeder Trieb ist herrschsüchtig: und als solcher versucht er zu\nphilosophiren. - Freihch: bei den Gelehrten, den eigenthch\nwissenschafthchen Menschen, mag es anders stehn - \"besser\", wenn man\nwill -, da mag es wirkhch so Etwas wie einen Erkenntnisstrieb geben,\nirgend ein kleines unabhängiges Uhrwerk, welches, gut aufgezogen,\ntapfer darauf los arbeitet, ohne dass die gesammten übrigen Triebe\ndes Gelehrten wesenthch dabei betheihgt sind. Die eigenthchen\n\"Interessen\" des Gelehrten hegen deshalb gewöhnhch ganz wo anders,\netwa in der Famihe oder im Gelderwerb oder in der Pohtik; ja es ist\nbeinahe gleichgültig, ob seine kleine Maschine an diese oder jene\nStelle der Wissenschaft gestellt wird, und ob der \"hoffnungsvolle\"\njunge Arbeiter aus sich einen guten Philologen oder Pilzekenner\noder Chemiker macht: - es bezeichnet ihn nicht, dass er dies oder\njenes wird. Umgekehrt ist an dem Philosophen ganz und gar nichts\nUnpersönhches; und insbesondere giebt seine Moral ein entschiedenes\n\nund entscheidendes Zeugniss dafür ab, wer er ist - das heisst, in\nwelcher Rangordnung die innersten Triebe seiner Natur zu einander\ngestellt sind.",

Accordingly, I do not believe that a “drive to knowledge” is the father of philosophy; but rather that another drive has, here as elsewhere, employed understanding (and misunderstanding) as a \nmere instrument. But anyone who considers the basic drives of man \nto see to what extent they may have been at play just here as inspiring spirits (or demons and kobolds) will find that all of them \nhave done philosophy at some time—and that every single one of \nthem would hke only too well to represent just itself as the ultimate \npurpose of existence and the legitimate master of all the other \n14 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \ndrives.

There is a mistrust of these modem ideas here, \nthere 1s a disbelief in everything built yesterday and today; perhaps it is \nmixed with a bit of antipathy and contempt that can no longer stand the \nbric-a-brac of concepts from the most heterogeneous sources, which is \n6 First cause. \nII \nBeyond Good and Evil \nhow so-called positivism puts itself on the market these days, a disgust felt \nby the more discriminating taste at the fun-fair colors and fhmsy scraps of \nall these reality-philosophasters who have nothing new and genuine about \nthem except these colors. Here, I think, we should give these skeptical \nanti-reahsts and epistemo-microscopists their just due: the instinct that \ndrives them away from modem reality is unassailable, — what do we care \nfor their retrograde shortcut! The essential thing about them is not that \nthey want to go “back”: but rather, that they want to get — away. A bit \nmore strength, flight, courage, artistry: and they would want to get up and \nout, — and not go back! — \nII \nIt seems to me that people everywhere these days are at pains to divert \nattention away from the real influence Kant exerted over German philosophy, and, in particular, wisely to overlook the value he attributed to \nhimself. First and foremost, Kant was proud of his table of categories,’ \n\n\nand he said with this table in his hands: “This is the hardest thing that \never could have been undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.\" — But let us \nbe clear about this “could have been”! He was proud of having discovered \na new faculty in humans, the faculty of synthetic judgments a priori. Of \ncourse he was deceiving himself here, but the development and rapid \nblossoming of German philosophy depended on this pride, and on the \ncompetitive zeal of the younger generation who wanted, if possible, to discover something even prouder — and in any event “new faculties”! — But \nthe time has come for us to think this over. How are synthetic judgments \na priori possible? Kant asked himself, — and what really was his answer? By \nvirtue of a faculty, which is to say: enabled by an abihty? unfortunately, \nthough, not in these few words, but rather so laboriously, reverentially, \nand with such an extravagance of German frills and profundity that people failed to hear the comical niaiserie allemande? in such an answer. In \nfact, people were beside themselves with joy over this new faculty, and \nthe jubilation reached its peak when Kant discovered yet another faculty, \na moral faculty: — because the Germans were still moral back then, and \n7 The reference in this section is to Kant's Kritik der reinen Vemunft (Critique of Pu\n1787). \n8 Tn German: Vermóge eines Vermögens. \n9 German silhness. \nI2 \nOn the prejudices of philosophers \nvery remote from Realpohtik. — The honeymoon of German philosophy \nhad arrived; all the young theologians of the Tübingen seminary”? ran off \ninto the bushes — they were all looking for “faculties.” And what didn't \nthey find — in that innocent, abundant, still youthful age of the German \nspirit, when Romanticism, that mahcious fairy, whispered, whistled, and \nsang, when people did not know how to tell the difference between “discovering\" and “inventing”!\"’ Above all, a faculty of the “supersensible”: \nSchelhng christened it intellectual intuition, and thus gratified the heart's \ndesire of his basically piety-craving Germans. We can do no greater injustice to this whole high-spirited and enthusiastic movement (which was \njust youthfulness, however boldly it might have clothed itself in gray and \nhoary concepts) than to take it seriously or especially to treat it with moral \nindignation. Enough, we grew up, — the dream faded away. There came \na time when people scratched their heads: some still scratch them today. There had been dreamers: first and foremost — the old Kant. “By \nvirtue of a faculty\" — he had said, or at least meant. But 1s that really — an \nanswer? An explanation? Or instead just a repetition of the question? So \n\n\nhow does opium cause sleep? “By virtue of a faculty,” namely the virtus \ndormitiva — replies the doctor in Mohère, \nquia est in eo virtus dormitiva, \ncujus est natura sensus assoupire.? \nBut answers hke this belong in comedy, and the time has finally come \nto replace the Kantian question “How are synthetic judgments a priori \npossible?” with another question, “Why is the belief in such judgments \nnecessary?\" — to reahze, in other words, that such judgments must be \nbelieved true for the purpose of preserving beings of our type; which \nis why these judgments could of course still be false! Or, to be blunt, \nbasic and clearer still: synthetic judgments a priori do not have “to be \npossible\" at all: we have no right to them, and in our mouths they are \nnothing but false judgments. It is only the belief in their truth that 1s \nnecessary as a foreground belief and piece of visual evidence, belonging \nto the perspectival optics of life. — And, finally, to recall the enormous \neffect that “the German philosophy” — its right to these quotation marks \n1° A reference to Hegel, Hölderhn, and Schelhng. \n™ In German: “‘finden’ und ‘erfinden.’ ”? \n12 “Because there is a dormative virtue in it / whose nature is to put the senses to sl\nMohére's Le Malade imaginaire (The Hypochondriac) (1673).",
        "Faber": "You want to /ive ‘according to nature’? Oh you noble Stoics,* what \n\n\ndeceit hes in these words! Imagine a creature constituted hke nature, \nprodigal beyond measure, neutral beyond measure, with no purpose \nor conscience, with no compassion or faimess, fertile and desolate \nand uncertain all at once; imagine Indifference itself as a power: \nhow could you live according to this indifference? To live—isn’t \nthat precisely the desire to be other than this nature? Doesn’t life \nmean weighing, preferring, being unjust, having limits, wanting to \nbe Different? And even if the real meaning of your imperative \n‘to live according to nature’ is ‘to live according to life-—how could \nyou do otherwise? Why make a principle out of something that you \nalready are and needs must be? \nThe truth is something else entirely: while you pretend to delight \nin reading the canon of your law from nature, you want the opposite, \nyou curious play-actors and self-deceivers! In your pride you want \nto dictate your morality, your ideals to nature, incorporate them \ninto nature, of all things; you demand that nature be ‘according to \nStoics’; you would hke to make all existence exist in accordance with \nyour own image alone—for the great and unending glorification and \nuniversahzation of Stoicism! With all your love of truth, you force \nyourselves to stare so long, so constantly, so hypnotically at nature \nthat you see it falsely, that is, stoically, and you become incapable \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers II \nof seeing it otherwise. And then out of some unfathomable arrogance you conceive the lunatic hope that because you know how to \ntyrannize yourself (Stoicism is self-tyranny), nature too can be tyrannized: for isn’t the Stoic a part of nature? ... \nBut this is an old, etemal story: what took place back then with \nthe Stoics is still taking place today, whenever a philosophy begins \nto believe in itself. It always creates the world according to its own \nimage, it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical drive \nitself, the most spiritual form of the will to power, to ‘creation of \nthe world’, to the causa prima.* \nI0 \nThe zeal and subtlety (I would almost hke to say ‘cunning’) with \nwhich everyone in Europe today is raising the question ‘of the real \nand the apparent world’ give us cause for thought and for hstening—and anyone who hears only a ‘will to truth’ in the \nbackground certainly does not have the sharpest ears. In a few rare, \nisolated cases a will to truth really may have played a part, an \nextravagant or adventurous mood, a metaphysician’s craving for the \n\n\nlost cause, a will that ultimately prefers a handful of ‘certainty’ to \na whole wagonload of beautiful possibihties; there may even be \nsome puritanical fanatics of conscience* who would rather lay down \ntheir lives for a certain Nothing than for an uncertain Something. \nBut however vahant the gestures of such virtue, this is nihihsm, \nthe sign of a despairing, mortally weary soul. With stronger, more \nvital thinkers, still thirsty for life, things are different: they take \nsides against appearance and are already pronouncing the word \n‘perspectivist’ with arrogance; they take the credibihty of their own \nbody about as seriously as the credibihty of the appearance that \n‘the earth stands still’. They seem to be ready cheerfully to let \ndrop from their hands their surest possession (for what do we \nbelieve in more surely than our bodies?) and who knows whether \nat bottom they might not want to regain something that they once \npossessed even more surely, something from the old homestead of \nbelief of earher times, the ‘immortal soul’ perhaps, or ‘the old \ngod’—ideas, in short, that led to a life that was better, more robust \nand serene, than the one our ‘modem ideas’ can lead to? In this \nquestion, there is mistrust of modem ideas, disbelief in everything \n12 Beyond Good and Evil \nconstructed yesterday and today; there may be a slight element of \ndisgust and contempt, from those no longer able to tolerate the \nhighly eclectic conceptual bric-a-brac that today’s so-called positivism brings to the market place; those with more fastidious taste \nare revolted by the fairground motley and frippery of all these \nreality-philosophists, who have nothing new or genuine apart from \ntheir motley. We should credit the sceptical anti-reahsts and knowledge-microscopists of today with at least this much, | think: we \nhave seen nothing to refute their instinct to escape from modem \nreality—thceir retrograde backroads are no concem of ours! What \nis important about them is not that they want to go ‘back’, but that \nthey want to go-—a may! With a httle more strength, more buoyancy, \ncourage, artistry, they would want to go beyond—and not back! \nII \nPeople today are trying, it seems to me, to divert attention from \nKant’s real influence on German philosophy, trying especially to \nevade what he himself considered his great value. Kant was most \nproud of his table of categories; holding it in his hands he said, \n‘This is the most difficult thing that ever could be undertaken for \nthe benefit of metaphysics.’ \nBut let us understand what this ‘could be’ really implies! He was \n\n\nproud of having discovered in man a new faculty, the faculty to \nmake synthetic a priori judgements. Granted that he was deceiving \nhimself about his discovery: nevertheless, the development and \nrapid flowering of German philosophy stem from this pride \nand from the rivalry of his disciples to discover if at all possible \nsomething worthy of even more pride—and in any event ‘new \nfaculties”! \nBut let’s think about it, it is high time. ‘How are synthetic a \npriori judgements possible? wondered Kant, and what did he \nanswer? They are facihtated by a faculty:* unfortunately, however, \nhe did not say this in four words, but so cumbersomely, so venerably, \nand with such an expense of German profundity and omateness \nthat people misheard the comical miaiserie allemande* in such an \nanswer. They were ecstatic about this new faculty, in fact, and the \nrejoicing reached its height when Kant discovered a moral faculty \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers 13 \nin man as well. (For at that time Germans were still moral, and \nnot yet ‘real-pohtical’.*) \nThere followed the honeymoon of German philosophy; all the \nyoung theologians of the Tiibingen Stift* headed right for the \nbushes—they were all looking for ‘faculties’. And what all didn’t \nthey find, in that innocent, rich, still youthful era of the German \nspirit when the mahcious elf Romanticism was still piping and \nsinging, back when no one yet had leamed to distinguish between \n‘finding’ and ‘inventing’!* They found above all a faculty for the \n‘extra-sensual’: Schelhng christened it ‘intellectual intuition’,* thus \nmeeting the dearest desires of his essentially pious-desirous \nGermans. One can do no greater injustice to this whole arrogant, \nenthusiastic movement (which was youth itself, however audaciously \nit may have cloaked itself in grey, senile concepts) than to take it \nseriously and treat it with anything hke moral indignation. Enough, \npeople grew older—the dream vanished. The time came for them \nto rub their foreheads: they are rubbing them still today. They had \nbeen dreaming, and the first among them had been old Kant. \n‘Facihtated by a faculty’—that’s what he had said, or at least that’s \nwhat he had meant. But what kind of an answer is that? What kind \nof explanation? Isn’t it rather simply repeating the question? How \ncan opium make us sleep? It is ‘facihtated by a faculty’, the virtus \ndormitiva, answers that doctor in Mohère, \nquia est in eo virtus dormitiva \ncujus est natura sensus assoupire.* \n\n\nBut answers hke these belong in comedy, and for the Kantian \nquestion ‘How are synthetic.a priori judgements possible?’ it is \nhigh time to substitute another question: ‘Why is the belief in \nsuch judgements necessary?’—it is time to understand that for the \npurpose of preserving creatures of our kind, we must believe that \nsuch judgements are true; which means, of course, that they could \nstill be false judgements. Or to put it more clearly, and crudely and \ncompletely: synthetic a priori judgements should not ‘be possible’ \nat all; we have no right to them, in our mouths they are only false \njudgements. Yet the belief in their truth happens to be necessary \nas one of the foreground beliefs and appearances that constitute \nthe perspective-optics of life. \nAnd, finally, remembering the enormous effect that ‘German \n14 Beyond Good and Evil \nphilosophy’ exercised throughout Europe (one understands, I hope, \nwhy it deserves quotation marks?), let no one doubt that a certain \nvirtus dormitiva had a part in it: amidst the noble men of leisure, \nthe morahsts, mystics, artists, the partial Christians, and pohtical \nobscurantists of every nation, people were delighted that German \nphilosophy offered an antidote to the still overpowering sensuahsm \npouring into this century from the previous one, in short: ‘sensus \nassoupire’. ..",

People were beside themselves with delight over this new fac^ ulty, and the jubilation reached its chmeix v/hen Kant further \ndiscovered a moral faculty in man — for at that time Germans \nwere still moral, not yet dabbhng in the \"Pohtics of hard \nfact.\" Then came the honeymoon of German philosophy. \nAll the young theologians of the Tiibingen institution went \nI mmediately into the groves — all seeking for \"faculties.\" \njri .tod what did they not find — in that innocent, rich, and still \nII \n12 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nyouthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, \nthe mahcious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet \ndistinguish between \"finding\" and \"inventing\"!

Enough, however — the world grew older, \nand the dream vanished. A time came when people rubbed \ntheir foreheads, and they still rub them to-day. People had \nbeen dreaming, and first and foremost — old Kant. \"By \nmeans of a means (faculty)\" — he had said, or at least meant \nto say. But, is that — an answer? An explanation? Or \n\n\nis it not rather merely a repetition of the question? How \ndoes opium induce sleep? \"By means of a means (faculty),\" \nnamely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in Mohere, \nQuia est in eo virtus dormitiva, \nCujus est natura sensus assoupire. \nBut such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is \nhigh time to replace the Kantian question, \"How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?\" by another question, \n\"Why is belief in such judgments necessary?\" — in effect, it \nhigh time that we should imderstand that such judgments, \nmust be believed to be true, for the sake of the preservation of creatures hke ourselves; though they still might] \nnaturally be false judgments!

And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence \nwhich \"German philosophy\" — I hope you understand its \nright to inverted commas (gooseteet)? — has exercised \nthroughout the whole of Europe, there is no doubt that a \ncertain virtus dormitiva had a share in it; thanks to German \nphilosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous, \nthe mystics, the artists, the three- fourths Christians, and the \npohtical obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to \nthe still overwhelming sensuahsm which overflowed from \nthe last century into this, in short — \"sensus assoupire.\" . . . \ny2 \nAs regards materiahstic atomism, it is one of the best \nrefuted theories that have been advanced, and in Europe \nthere is now perhaps no one in the leamed world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it, except for \nconvenient everyday use (as an abbreviation of the means \nof expression) — thanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he \nand the Pole Copemicus have hitherto been the greatest and \nmost successful opponents of ocular evidence. For whilst \nCopemicus has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the \nsenses, that the earth does not stand fast, Boscovich has \ntaught us to abjure the belief in the last thing that \"stood \n\n\nfast\" of the earth — the belief in \"substance,\" in \"matter,\" \nin the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest \ntriumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on \nearth. One must, however, go still further, and also declare \nwar, relentless war to the knife, against the \"atomistic requirements\" which still lead a dangerous after-life in places \n14 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nwhere no one suspects them, hke the more celebrated \"metaphysical requirements\": one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism \nwhich Christianity has taught best and longest, the soulatomism. Let it be permitted to designate by this expression \nthe belief which regards the soul as something indestructible, \netemal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief \nought to be expelled from science! Between ourselves, it is \nnot at all necessary to get rid of \"the soul\" thereby, and thus \nrenounce one of the oldest and most venerated hj^otheses — \nas happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturahsts, who \ncan hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it. \nBut the way is open for new acceptations and refinements of \nthe soul-hypothesis; and such conceptions as \"mortal soul,\" \nand \"soul of subjective multiphcity,\" and \"soul as social \nstructure of the instincts and passions,\" want henceforth to \nhave legitimate rights in science. In that the new psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have \nhitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the \nidea of the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into \na new desert and a new distrust — it is possible that the older \npsychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of \nit; eventually, however, he finds that precisely thereby he \nis also condemned to invent — and, who knows? perhaps to \ndiscover the new."
