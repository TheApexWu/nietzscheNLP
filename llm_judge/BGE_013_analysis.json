Vor Allem will etwas Lebendiges seine Kraft auslassen — Leben selbst ist Wille zur Macht — die Selbsterhaltung ist nur eine der indirekten und häufigsten Folgen davon. — Kurz, hier wie überall, Vorsicht vor überflüssigen teleologischen Principien! — wie ein solches der Selbsterhaltungstrieb ist (man dankt ihn der Inconsequenz Spinoza's —). So nämlich gebietet es die Methode, die wesentlich Principien-Sparsamkeit sein muss.",

The capitalization is an interpretive choice that Nietzsche didn't make in German. Very literal, but 'thereof' and 'bethink' add Victorian formality that flattens Nietzsche's punch.",

Kaufmann, Hollingdale, and Zimmern preserve the predication structure (no article). Faber and Norman add 'the,' which shifts from identity claim to attributive claim.",

  "overall_notes": "This aphorism demonstrates where LLM-as-Judge captures nuances that embedding-based similarity would flatten. All five translations would cluster tightly in embedding space due to shared vocabulary, but they diverge on: (1) article insertion, (2) verb intensity (discharge/vent/release), (3) register (bethink/think twice), (4) capitalization as conceptual reification.",
