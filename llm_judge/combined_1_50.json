It \nalways creates the world in its own image, it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical drive itself, the most spiritual will to power, to the \n“creation of the world,” to the causa prima.^ \nIO \nAll over Europe these days, the problem “of the real and the apparent \nworld\" gets taken up so eagerly and with such acuity — I would even say: \nshrewdness — that you really start to think and hsten; and anyone who \nhears only a *will to truth\" in the background here certainly does not have \nthe sharpest of ears. In rare and unusual cases, some sort of will to truth \nmight actually be at issue, some wild and adventurous streak of courage, \na metaphysician's ambition to hold on to a lost cause, that, in the end, \n\n\nwill still prefer a handful of “certainty” to an entire wagonload of pretty \npossibihties. There might even be puritanical fanatics of conscience who \nwould rather he dying on an assured nothing than an uncertain something. \nBut this is nihihsm, and symptomatic of a desperate soul in a state of \ndeadly exhaustion, however brave such virtuous posturing may appear. \nWith stronger, liveher thinkers, however, thinkers who still have a thirst for \nlife, things look different. By taking sides against appearance and speaking \nabout “perspective” in a newly arrogant tone, by granting their own bodies \nabout as httle credibihty as they grant the visual evidence that says “the \nearth stands still,” and so, with seemingly good spirits, rehnquishing their \nmost secure possession (since what do people believe in more securely \nthese days than their bodies?), who knows whether they are not basically \ntrying to re-appropriate something that was once possessed even more \nsecurely, something from the old estate of a bygone faith, perhaps “the \nimmortal soul\" or perhaps *the old God,\" in short, ideas that helped \nmake life a bit better, which is to say stronger and more cheerful than \n“modem ideas\" can do? There is a mistrust of these modem ideas here, \nthere 1s a disbelief in everything built yesterday and today; perhaps it is \nmixed with a bit of antipathy and contempt that can no longer stand the \nbric-a-brac of concepts from the most heterogeneous sources, which is \n6 First cause. \nII \nBeyond Good and Evil \nhow so-called positivism puts itself on the market these days, a disgust felt \nby the more discriminating taste at the fun-fair colors and fhmsy scraps of \nall these reality-philosophasters who have nothing new and genuine about \nthem except these colors. Here, I think, we should give these skeptical \nanti-reahsts and epistemo-microscopists their just due: the instinct that \ndrives them away from modem reality is unassailable, — what do we care \nfor their retrograde shortcut! The essential thing about them is not that \nthey want to go “back”: but rather, that they want to get — away. A bit \nmore strength, flight, courage, artistry: and they would want to get up and \nout, — and not go back! — \nII \nIt seems to me that people everywhere these days are at pains to divert \nattention away from the real influence Kant exerted over German philosophy, and, in particular, wisely to overlook the value he attributed to \nhimself. First and foremost, Kant was proud of his table of categories,’ \n\n\nand he said with this table in his hands: “This is the hardest thing that \never could have been undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.\" — But let us \nbe clear about this “could have been”! He was proud of having discovered \na new faculty in humans, the faculty of synthetic judgments a priori. Of \ncourse he was deceiving himself here, but the development and rapid \nblossoming of German philosophy depended on this pride, and on the \ncompetitive zeal of the younger generation who wanted, if possible, to discover something even prouder — and in any event “new faculties”! — But \nthe time has come for us to think this over. How are synthetic judgments \na priori possible? Kant asked himself, — and what really was his answer? By \nvirtue of a faculty, which is to say: enabled by an abihty? unfortunately, \nthough, not in these few words, but rather so laboriously, reverentially, \nand with such an extravagance of German frills and profundity that people failed to hear the comical niaiserie allemande? in such an answer. In \nfact, people were beside themselves with joy over this new faculty, and \nthe jubilation reached its peak when Kant discovered yet another faculty, \na moral faculty: — because the Germans were still moral back then, and \n7 The reference in this section is to Kant's Kritik der reinen Vemunft (Critique of Pu\n1787). \n8 Tn German: Vermóge eines Vermögens. \n9 German silhness. \nI2 \nOn the prejudices of philosophers \nvery remote from Realpohtik. — The honeymoon of German philosophy \nhad arrived; all the young theologians of the Tübingen seminary”? ran off \ninto the bushes — they were all looking for “faculties.” And what didn't \nthey find — in that innocent, abundant, still youthful age of the German \nspirit, when Romanticism, that mahcious fairy, whispered, whistled, and \nsang, when people did not know how to tell the difference between “discovering\" and “inventing”!\"’ Above all, a faculty of the “supersensible”: \nSchelhng christened it intellectual intuition, and thus gratified the heart's \ndesire of his basically piety-craving Germans. We can do no greater injustice to this whole high-spirited and enthusiastic movement (which was \njust youthfulness, however boldly it might have clothed itself in gray and \nhoary concepts) than to take it seriously or especially to treat it with moral \nindignation. Enough, we grew up, — the dream faded away. There came \na time when people scratched their heads: some still scratch them today. There had been dreamers: first and foremost — the old Kant. “By \nvirtue of a faculty\" — he had said, or at least meant. But 1s that really — an \nanswer? An explanation? Or instead just a repetition of the question? So \n\n\nhow does opium cause sleep? “By virtue of a faculty,” namely the virtus \ndormitiva — replies the doctor in Mohère, \nquia est in eo virtus dormitiva, \ncujus est natura sensus assoupire.? \nBut answers hke this belong in comedy, and the time has finally come \nto replace the Kantian question “How are synthetic judgments a priori \npossible?” with another question, “Why is the belief in such judgments \nnecessary?\" — to reahze, in other words, that such judgments must be \nbelieved true for the purpose of preserving beings of our type; which \nis why these judgments could of course still be false! Or, to be blunt, \nbasic and clearer still: synthetic judgments a priori do not have “to be \npossible\" at all: we have no right to them, and in our mouths they are \nnothing but false judgments. It is only the belief in their truth that 1s \nnecessary as a foreground belief and piece of visual evidence, belonging \nto the perspectival optics of life. — And, finally, to recall the enormous \neffect that “the German philosophy” — its right to these quotation marks \n1° A reference to Hegel, Hölderhn, and Schelhng. \n™ In German: “‘finden’ und ‘erfinden.’ ”? \n12 “Because there is a dormative virtue in it / whose nature is to put the senses to sl\nMohére's Le Malade imaginaire (The Hypochondriac) (1673).",
        "Faber": "You want to /ive ‘according to nature’? Oh you noble Stoics,* what \n\n\ndeceit hes in these words! Imagine a creature constituted hke nature, \nprodigal beyond measure, neutral beyond measure, with no purpose \nor conscience, with no compassion or faimess, fertile and desolate \nand uncertain all at once; imagine Indifference itself as a power: \nhow could you live according to this indifference? To live—isn’t \nthat precisely the desire to be other than this nature? Doesn’t life \nmean weighing, preferring, being unjust, having limits, wanting to \nbe Different? And even if the real meaning of your imperative \n‘to live according to nature’ is ‘to live according to life-—how could \nyou do otherwise? Why make a principle out of something that you \nalready are and needs must be? \nThe truth is something else entirely: while you pretend to delight \nin reading the canon of your law from nature, you want the opposite, \nyou curious play-actors and self-deceivers! In your pride you want \nto dictate your morality, your ideals to nature, incorporate them \ninto nature, of all things; you demand that nature be ‘according to \nStoics’; you would hke to make all existence exist in accordance with \nyour own image alone—for the great and unending glorification and \nuniversahzation of Stoicism! With all your love of truth, you force \nyourselves to stare so long, so constantly, so hypnotically at nature \nthat you see it falsely, that is, stoically, and you become incapable \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers II \nof seeing it otherwise. And then out of some unfathomable arrogance you conceive the lunatic hope that because you know how to \ntyrannize yourself (Stoicism is self-tyranny), nature too can be tyrannized: for isn’t the Stoic a part of nature? ... \nBut this is an old, etemal story: what took place back then with \nthe Stoics is still taking place today, whenever a philosophy begins \nto believe in itself. It always creates the world according to its own \nimage, it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical drive \nitself, the most spiritual form of the will to power, to ‘creation of \nthe world’, to the causa prima.* \nI0 \nThe zeal and subtlety (I would almost hke to say ‘cunning’) with \nwhich everyone in Europe today is raising the question ‘of the real \nand the apparent world’ give us cause for thought and for hstening—and anyone who hears only a ‘will to truth’ in the \nbackground certainly does not have the sharpest ears. In a few rare, \nisolated cases a will to truth really may have played a part, an \nextravagant or adventurous mood, a metaphysician’s craving for the \n\n\nlost cause, a will that ultimately prefers a handful of ‘certainty’ to \na whole wagonload of beautiful possibihties; there may even be \nsome puritanical fanatics of conscience* who would rather lay down \ntheir lives for a certain Nothing than for an uncertain Something. \nBut however vahant the gestures of such virtue, this is nihihsm, \nthe sign of a despairing, mortally weary soul. With stronger, more \nvital thinkers, still thirsty for life, things are different: they take \nsides against appearance and are already pronouncing the word \n‘perspectivist’ with arrogance; they take the credibihty of their own \nbody about as seriously as the credibihty of the appearance that \n‘the earth stands still’. They seem to be ready cheerfully to let \ndrop from their hands their surest possession (for what do we \nbelieve in more surely than our bodies?) and who knows whether \nat bottom they might not want to regain something that they once \npossessed even more surely, something from the old homestead of \nbelief of earher times, the ‘immortal soul’ perhaps, or ‘the old \ngod’—ideas, in short, that led to a life that was better, more robust \nand serene, than the one our ‘modem ideas’ can lead to? In this \nquestion, there is mistrust of modem ideas, disbelief in everything \n12 Beyond Good and Evil \nconstructed yesterday and today; there may be a slight element of \ndisgust and contempt, from those no longer able to tolerate the \nhighly eclectic conceptual bric-a-brac that today’s so-called positivism brings to the market place; those with more fastidious taste \nare revolted by the fairground motley and frippery of all these \nreality-philosophists, who have nothing new or genuine apart from \ntheir motley. We should credit the sceptical anti-reahsts and knowledge-microscopists of today with at least this much, | think: we \nhave seen nothing to refute their instinct to escape from modem \nreality—thceir retrograde backroads are no concem of ours! What \nis important about them is not that they want to go ‘back’, but that \nthey want to go-—a may! With a httle more strength, more buoyancy, \ncourage, artistry, they would want to go beyond—and not back! \nII \nPeople today are trying, it seems to me, to divert attention from \nKant’s real influence on German philosophy, trying especially to \nevade what he himself considered his great value. Kant was most \nproud of his table of categories; holding it in his hands he said, \n‘This is the most difficult thing that ever could be undertaken for \nthe benefit of metaphysics.’ \nBut let us understand what this ‘could be’ really implies! He was \n\n\nproud of having discovered in man a new faculty, the faculty to \nmake synthetic a priori judgements. Granted that he was deceiving \nhimself about his discovery: nevertheless, the development and \nrapid flowering of German philosophy stem from this pride \nand from the rivalry of his disciples to discover if at all possible \nsomething worthy of even more pride—and in any event ‘new \nfaculties”! \nBut let’s think about it, it is high time. ‘How are synthetic a \npriori judgements possible? wondered Kant, and what did he \nanswer? They are facihtated by a faculty:* unfortunately, however, \nhe did not say this in four words, but so cumbersomely, so venerably, \nand with such an expense of German profundity and omateness \nthat people misheard the comical miaiserie allemande* in such an \nanswer. They were ecstatic about this new faculty, in fact, and the \nrejoicing reached its height when Kant discovered a moral faculty \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers 13 \nin man as well. (For at that time Germans were still moral, and \nnot yet ‘real-pohtical’.*) \nThere followed the honeymoon of German philosophy; all the \nyoung theologians of the Tiibingen Stift* headed right for the \nbushes—they were all looking for ‘faculties’. And what all didn’t \nthey find, in that innocent, rich, still youthful era of the German \nspirit when the mahcious elf Romanticism was still piping and \nsinging, back when no one yet had leamed to distinguish between \n‘finding’ and ‘inventing’!* They found above all a faculty for the \n‘extra-sensual’: Schelhng christened it ‘intellectual intuition’,* thus \nmeeting the dearest desires of his essentially pious-desirous \nGermans. One can do no greater injustice to this whole arrogant, \nenthusiastic movement (which was youth itself, however audaciously \nit may have cloaked itself in grey, senile concepts) than to take it \nseriously and treat it with anything hke moral indignation. Enough, \npeople grew older—the dream vanished. The time came for them \nto rub their foreheads: they are rubbing them still today. They had \nbeen dreaming, and the first among them had been old Kant. \n‘Facihtated by a faculty’—that’s what he had said, or at least that’s \nwhat he had meant. But what kind of an answer is that? What kind \nof explanation? Isn’t it rather simply repeating the question? How \ncan opium make us sleep? It is ‘facihtated by a faculty’, the virtus \ndormitiva, answers that doctor in Mohère, \nquia est in eo virtus dormitiva \ncujus est natura sensus assoupire.* \n\n\nBut answers hke these belong in comedy, and for the Kantian \nquestion ‘How are synthetic.a priori judgements possible?’ it is \nhigh time to substitute another question: ‘Why is the belief in \nsuch judgements necessary?’—it is time to understand that for the \npurpose of preserving creatures of our kind, we must believe that \nsuch judgements are true; which means, of course, that they could \nstill be false judgements. Or to put it more clearly, and crudely and \ncompletely: synthetic a priori judgements should not ‘be possible’ \nat all; we have no right to them, in our mouths they are only false \njudgements. Yet the belief in their truth happens to be necessary \nas one of the foreground beliefs and appearances that constitute \nthe perspective-optics of life. \nAnd, finally, remembering the enormous effect that ‘German \n14 Beyond Good and Evil \nphilosophy’ exercised throughout Europe (one understands, I hope, \nwhy it deserves quotation marks?), let no one doubt that a certain \nvirtus dormitiva had a part in it: amidst the noble men of leisure, \nthe morahsts, mystics, artists, the partial Christians, and pohtical \nobscurantists of every nation, people were delighted that German \nphilosophy offered an antidote to the still overpowering sensuahsm \npouring into this century from the previous one, in short: ‘sensus \nassoupire’. ..",

A httle more strength, swing, courage, and \nartistic power, and they would be o§ — and not back! \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL ii \nI \nIX \nIt seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at \npresent to divert attention from the actual influence which \nKant exercised on German philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon himself. Kant \n\n\nwas first and foremost proud of his Table of Categories; \nwith it in his hand he said: \"This is the most difficult thing \nthat could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.\" \nLet us only understand this \"could be\"! He was proud of \nhaving discovered a new faculty in man, the faculty of \nsynthetic judgment a priori. Granting that he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid flourishing \nof German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, \nand on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible something — at all events \"new faculties\" — \nof which to be still prouder! — But let us reflect for a \nmoment — it is high time to do so. \"How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?\" Kant asks himself — and what is \nreally his answer? \"By means of a means (faculty)\" — ^but \nunfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly, and with such display of German profimdity and \nverbal flourishes, that one altogether loses sight of the \ncomical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer. People were beside themselves with delight over this new fac^ ulty, and the jubilation reached its chmeix v/hen Kant further \ndiscovered a moral faculty in man — for at that time Germans \nwere still moral, not yet dabbhng in the \"Pohtics of hard \nfact.\" Then came the honeymoon of German philosophy. \nAll the young theologians of the Tiibingen institution went \nI mmediately into the groves — all seeking for \"faculties.\" \njri .tod what did they not find — in that innocent, rich, and still \nII \n12 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nyouthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, \nthe mahcious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet \ndistinguish between \"finding\" and \"inventing\"! Above all \na faculty for the \"transcendental\"; Schelhng christened it, \nintellectual intuition, and thereby gratified the most eamest \nlongings of the naturally pious-inclined Germans. One can \ndo no greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness, notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly in hoary and senile \nconceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with \nmoral indignation. Enough, however — the world grew older, \nand the dream vanished. A time came when people rubbed \ntheir foreheads, and they still rub them to-day. People had \nbeen dreaming, and first and foremost — old Kant. \"By \nmeans of a means (faculty)\" — he had said, or at least meant \nto say. But, is that — an answer? An explanation? Or \n\n\nis it not rather merely a repetition of the question? How \ndoes opium induce sleep? \"By means of a means (faculty),\" \nnamely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in Mohere, \nQuia est in eo virtus dormitiva, \nCujus est natura sensus assoupire. \nBut such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is \nhigh time to replace the Kantian question, \"How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?\" by another question, \n\"Why is belief in such judgments necessary?\" — in effect, it \nhigh time that we should imderstand that such judgments, \nmust be believed to be true, for the sake of the preservation of creatures hke ourselves; though they still might] \nnaturally be false judgments! Or, more plainly spokeUjj \nand roughly and readily — synthetic judgments a priori shoulc \nnot \"be possible\" at all; we have no right to them; in oui \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 13 \nmouths they are nothing but false judgments). Only, of \ncourse, the belief in their truth is necessary, as plausible \nbelief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view \nof life. And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence \nwhich \"German philosophy\" — I hope you understand its \nright to inverted commas (gooseteet)? — has exercised \nthroughout the whole of Europe, there is no doubt that a \ncertain virtus dormitiva had a share in it; thanks to German \nphilosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous, \nthe mystics, the artists, the three- fourths Christians, and the \npohtical obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to \nthe still overwhelming sensuahsm which overflowed from \nthe last century into this, in short — \"sensus assoupire.\" . . . \ny2 \nAs regards materiahstic atomism, it is one of the best \nrefuted theories that have been advanced, and in Europe \nthere is now perhaps no one in the leamed world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it, except for \nconvenient everyday use (as an abbreviation of the means \nof expression) — thanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he \nand the Pole Copemicus have hitherto been the greatest and \nmost successful opponents of ocular evidence. For whilst \nCopemicus has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the \nsenses, that the earth does not stand fast, Boscovich has \ntaught us to abjure the belief in the last thing that \"stood \n\n\nfast\" of the earth — the belief in \"substance,\" in \"matter,\" \nin the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest \ntriumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on \nearth. One must, however, go still further, and also declare \nwar, relentless war to the knife, against the \"atomistic requirements\" which still lead a dangerous after-life in places \n14 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nwhere no one suspects them, hke the more celebrated \"metaphysical requirements\": one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism \nwhich Christianity has taught best and longest, the soulatomism. Let it be permitted to designate by this expression \nthe belief which regards the soul as something indestructible, \netemal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief \nought to be expelled from science! Between ourselves, it is \nnot at all necessary to get rid of \"the soul\" thereby, and thus \nrenounce one of the oldest and most venerated hj^otheses — \nas happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturahsts, who \ncan hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it. \nBut the way is open for new acceptations and refinements of \nthe soul-hypothesis; and such conceptions as \"mortal soul,\" \nand \"soul of subjective multiphcity,\" and \"soul as social \nstructure of the instincts and passions,\" want henceforth to \nhave legitimate rights in science. In that the new psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have \nhitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the \nidea of the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into \na new desert and a new distrust — it is possible that the older \npsychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of \nit; eventually, however, he finds that precisely thereby he \nis also condemned to invent — and, who knows? perhaps to \ndiscover the new."

Kant war vor Allem und\nzuerst stolz auf seine Kategorientafel, er sagte mit dieser Tafel\nin den Händen: \"das ist das Schwerste, was jemals zum Behufe der\nMetaphysik untemommen werden konnte\". - Man verstehe doch dies\n\"werden konnte\"! er war stolz darauf, im Menschen ein neues Vermögen,\ndas Vermögen zu synthetischen Urteilen a priori, entdeckt zu haben.\nGesetzt, dass er sich hierin selbst betrog: aber die Entwicklung und\nrasche Blüthe der deutschen Philosophie hängt an diesem Stolze und an\ndem Wetteifer aller Jüngeren, womöghch noch Stolzeres zu entdeckenund jedenfalls \"neue Vermögen\"! - Aber besinnen wir uns: es ist an der\nZeit.

Wie macht doch das Opium schlafen? \"Vermöge\neines Vermögens\", nämhch der virtus dormitiva - antwortet jener Arzt\nbei Mohère,\n quia est in eo virtus dormitiva,\n cujus est natura sensus assoupire.\nAber dergleichen Antworten gehören in die Komödie, und es ist endhch\nan der Zeit, die Kantische Frage \"Wie sind synthetische Urtheile a\npriori möghch?\" durch eine andre Frage zu ersetzen \"warum ist der\nGlaube an solche Urtheile nöthig?\" - nämhch zu begreifen, dass zum\nZweck der Erhaltung von Wesen unsrer Art solche Urtheile als wahr\ngeglaubt werden müssen; weshalb sie natürhch noch falsche Urtheile\nsein könnten!

Aber es dünkt mich immer wieder, dass\nSchopenhauer auch in diesem Falle nur gethan hat, was Philosophen\neben zu thun pflegen: dass er ein Volks-Vorurtheil übemommen und\nübertrieben hat. Wollen scheint mir vor Allem etwas Comphcirtes,\nEtwas, das nur als Wort eine Einheit ist, - und eben im Einen Worte\nsteckt das Volks-Vorurtheil, das über die allzeit nur geringe Vorsicht\nder Philosophen Herr geworden ist. Seien wir also einmal vorsichtiger,\nseien wir \"unphilosophisch\" -, sagen wir: in jedem Wollen ist erstens\neine Mehrheit von Gefühlen, nämhch das Gefühl des Zustandes, von dem\nweg, das Gefühl des Zustandes, zu dem hin, das Gefühl von diesem \"weg\"\nund \"hin\" selbst, dann noch ein begleitendes Muskelgefühl, welches,\nauch ohne dass wir \"Arme und Beine\" in Bewegung setzen, durch eine Art\nGewohnheit, sobald wir \"wollen\", sein Spiel beginnt. Wie also Fühlen\nund zwar vielerlei Fühlen als Ingredienz des Willens anzuerkennen ist,\nso zweitens auch noch Denken: in jedem Willensakte giebt es einen\ncommandirenden Gedanken; - und man soll ja nicht glauben, diesen\nGedanken von dem \"Wollen\" abscheiden zu können, wie als ob dann noch\nWille übrig bhebe! Drittens ist der Wille nicht nur ein Complex von\nFühlen und Denken, sondem vor Allem noch ein Affekt: und zwar jener\nAffekt des Commando's. Das, was \"Freiheit des Willens\" genannt wird,\nist wesenthch der Überlegenheits-Affekt in Hinsicht auf Den, der\ngehorchen muss: \"ich bin frei, \"er\" muss gehorchen\" - dies Bewusstsein\nsteckt in jedem Willen, und ebenso jene Spannung der Aufmerksamkeit,\njener gerade Bhck, der ausschhesshch Eins fixirt, jene unbedingte\nWerthschätzung \"jetzt thut dies und nichts Anderes Noth\", jene innere\nGewissheit darüber, dass gehorcht werden wird, und was Alles noch zum\nZustande des Befehlenden gehört. Ein Mensch, der will -, befiehlt\neinem Etwas in sich, das gehorcht oder von dem er glaubt, dass es\n\ngehorcht. Nun aber beachte man, was das Wunderhchste am Willen ist,\n- an diesem so vielfachen Dinge, für welches das Volk nur Ein Wort\nhat: insofem wir im gegebenen Falle zugleich die Befehlenden und\nGehorchenden sind, und als Gehorchende die Gefühle des Zwingens,\nDrängens, Drückens, Widerstehens, Bewegens kennen, welche sofort nach\ndem Akte des Willens zu beginnen pflegen; insofem wir andererseits\ndie Gewohnheit haben, uns über diese Zweiheit vermöge des\nsynthetischen Begriffs \"ich\" hinwegzusetzen, hinwegzutäuschen, hat\nsich an das Wollen noch eine ganze Kette von irrthümhchen Schlüssen\nund folghch von falschen Werthschätzungen des Willens selbst\nangehängt, - dergestalt, dass der Wollende mit gutem Glauben glaubt,\nWollen genüge zur Aktion. Weil in den allermeisten Fällen nur gewollt\nworden ist, wo auch die Wirkung des Befehls, also der Gehorsam, also\ndie Aktion erwartet werden durfte, so hat sich der Anschein in das\nGefühl übersetzt, als ob es da eine Nothwendigkeit von Wirkung gäbe;\ngenug, der Wollende glaubt, mit einem ziemhchen Grad von Sicherheit,\ndass Wille und Aktion irgendwie Eins seien -, er rechnet das Gehngen,\ndie Ausführung des Wollens noch dem Willen selbst zu und geniesst\ndabei einen Zuwachs jenes Machtgefühls, welches alles Gehngen mit\nsich bringt. \"Freiheit des Willens\" - das ist das Wort für jenen\nvielfachen Lust-Zustand des Wollenden, der befiehlt und sich zugleich\nmit dem Ausführenden als Eins setzt, - der als solcher den Triumph\nüber Widerstände mit geniesst, aber bei sich urtheilt, sein Wille\nselbst sei es, der eigenthch die Widerstände überwinde.

        "Kaufmann": "Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as if it were \nthe best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given \nus to understand that the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and completely known, without subtraction or addition. \nBut again and again it seems to me that in this case, too, Schopenhauer only did what philosophers are in the habit of doing—he \nadopted a popular prejudice and exaggerated it. Wilhng seems to \nme to be above all something complicated, something that is a unit \nonly as a word—and it is precisely in this one word that the popular \nprejudice lurks, which has defeated the always inadequate caution of philosophers. So let us for once be more cautious, let us be \n“unphilosophical”: let us say that in all wilhng there is, first, a \nplurahty of sensations, namely, the sensation of the state “away \nfrom which,” the sensation of the state “towards which,” the sensations of this “from” and “towards” themselves, and then also an accompanying muscular sensation, which, even without our putting \ninto motion “arms and legs,” begins its action by force of habit as \nsoon as we “will” anything. \nTherefore, just as sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are to be recognized as ingredients of the will, so, secondly, \nshould thinking also: in every act of the will there is a ruhng \nthought—let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from \nthe “wilhng,” as if any will would then remain over! \nThird, the will is not only a complex of sensation and thinking, but it is above all an affect, and specifically the affect of the \ncommand, That which is termed “freedom of the will” is essentially the affect of superiority in relation to him who must obey:. “I \nam free, ‘he’ must obey”—this consciousness is inherent in every \nwill; and equally so the straining of the attention, the straight look \nthat fixes itself exclusively on one aim, the unconditional evaluation that “this and nothing else is necessary now,” the inward \n26 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \n\n\ncertainty that obedience will be rendered—-and whatever else belongs to the position of the commander. A man who wills commands something within himself that renders obedience, or that he \nbelieves renders obedience. \nBut now let us notice what is strangest about the will—this \nmanifold thing for which the people have only one word: inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the same time the \ncommanding and the obeying parties, and as the obeying party we \nknow the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, \nand motion, which usually begin immediately after the act of will; \ninasmuch as, on the other hand, we are accustomed to disregard \nthis duahty, and to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic concept “I,” a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and \nconsequently of false evaluations of the will itself, has become attached to the act of wilhng—to such a degree that he who wills believes sincerely that wilhng suffices for action. Since in the great \nmajority of cases there has been exercise of will only when the effect of the command—that is, obedience; that is, the action—was \nto be expected, the appearance has translated itself into the feehng, \nas if there were a necessity of effect. In short, he who wills believes \nwith a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow \none; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the wilhng, to the \nwill itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power \nwhich accompanies all success. \n“Freedom of the will”—that is the expression for the complex \nstate of delight of the person exercising vohtion, who commands \nand at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order—who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but \nthinks within himself that it was really his will itself that overcame \nthem. In this way the person exercising vohtion adds the feehngs of \ndelight of his successful executive instruments, the useful “underwills” or under-souls—indeed, our body is but a social structure \ncomposed of many souls—to his feehngs of delight as commander. \nL'effet c'est moi? what happens here is what happens in every \nwell-constructed and happy commonwealth; namely, the goveming \n22 “7 am the effect.” \nON THE PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS 27 \nclass identifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth. In all \nwilhng it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on \nthe basis, as already said, of a social structure composed of many \n“souls.” Hence a philosopher should claim the right to include willing as such within the sphere of morals—morals being understood \nas the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of “life” comes to be.",
        "Hollingdale": "Philosophers are given to speaking of the will as if it were the best-known thing in \nthe world; Schopenhauer, indeed, would have us understand that the will alone is \ntruly known to us, known completely, known without deduction or addition. But it \nseems to me that in this case too Schopenhauer has done only what philosophers in \ngeneral are given to doing: that he has taken up a popular prejudice and exaggerated \nit. Wilhng seems to me to be above all something complicated, something that is a \nunity only as a word — and it is precisely in this one word that the popular prejudice \nresides which has overbome the always inadequate caution of the philosophers. Let \nus therefore be more cautious for once, let us be ‘unphilosophical’ — let us say: in al\nwilhng there is, first of all, a plurahty of sensations, namely the sensation of the \ncondition we leave, the sensation of the condition towards which we go, the \nsensation of this ‘leaving’ and ‘going’ itself, and then also an accompanying \nmuscular sensation which, even without our putting ‘arms and legs’ in motion, \ncomes into play through a kind of habit as soon as we ‘will’. As feehngs, and indeed \nmany varieties of feehng, can therefore be recognized as an ingredient of will, so, in\nthe second place, can thinking: in every act of will there is a commanding thought — \nand do not imagine that this thought can be separated from the ‘wilhng’, as though \nwill would then remain over! Thirdly, will is not only a complex of feehng and \n\n\nthinking, but above all an affect: and in fact the affect of command. What is called \n‘freedom of will’ is essentially the affect of superiority over him who must obey: ʻI \nam free, “he” must obey’ — this consciousness adheres to every will, as does that \ntense attention, that straight look which fixes itself exclusively on one thing, that \nunconditional evaluation ‘this and nothing else is necessary now’, that inner \ncertainty that one will be obeyed, and whatever else pertains to the state of him who \ngives commands. A man who wills — commands something in himself which obeys \nor which he believes obeys. But now observe the strangest thing of all about the will \n— about this so complex thing for which people have only one word: inasmuch as in \nthe given circumstances we at the same time command and obey, and as the side \nwhich obeys know the sensations of constraint, compulsion, pressure, resistance, \nmotion which usually begin immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the \nother hand, we are in the habit of disregarding and deceiving ourselves over this \nduahty by means of the synthetic concept ‘T; so a whole chain of erroneous \nconclusions and consequently of false evaluations of the will itself has become \nattached to the will as such — so that he who wills believes wholeheartedly that \nwilhng suffices for action. Because in the great majority of cases wilhng takes place\nonly where the effect of the command, that is to say obedience, that is to say the \naction, was to be expected, the appearance has translated itself into the sensation, as\nif there were here a necessity of effect. Enough: he who wills believes with a \ntolerable degree of certainty that will and action are somehow one — he attributes \nthe success, the carrying out of the wilhng, to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an\nincrease of that sensation of power which all success brings with it. ‘Freedom of \nwill’ — is the expression for that complex condition of pleasure of the person who \nwills, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of \nthe command — who as such also enjoys the triumph over resistances involved but \nwho thinks it was his will itself which overcame these resistances. He who wills \nadds in this way the sensations of pleasure of the successful executive agents, the \nserviceable ‘under-wills’ or under-souls — for our body is only a social structure \ncomposed of many souls — to his sensations of pleasure as commander. L'effet, c'est \nmoi: what happens here is what happens in every well-constructed and happy \ncommonwealth: the ruhng class identifies itself with the successes of the \ncommonwealth. In all wilhng it is absolutely a question of commanding and \nobeying, on the basis, as I have said already, of a social structure composed of \nmany ‘souls’: on which account a philosopher should claim the right to include \nwilhng as such within the field of morality: that is, of morality understood as the \ntheory of the relations of dominance under which the phenomenon ‘life’ arises. —",

        "Faber": "Philosophers tend to speak about the will as if everyone in the \nworld knew all about it; Schopenhauer even suggested that the will \nwas the only thing we actually do know, know through and through, \nknow without additions or subtractions. But I continue to think \nthat even in this case Schopenhauer was only doing what philosophers simply tend to do: appropriating and exaggerating a common \nprejudice. As I see it, the act of wilhng is above all something \ncomplicated, something that has unity only as a word—and this \ncommon prejudice of using only one word has overridden the \nphilosophers’ caution (which was never all that great anyway). So \nlet us be more cautious for once, let us be ‘unphilosophical’. Let \nus say that in every act of wilhng there is first of all a multiphcity \nof feehngs, namely the feehng of the condition we are moving away \nfrom and the feehng of the condition we are moving towards; the \nfeehng of this ‘away’ and this ‘towards’; and then a concomitant \nfeehng in the muscles that, without our actually moving ‘arms and \nlegs’, comes into play out of a kind of habit, whenever we ‘will’. \nSecond, just as we must recognize feehng, and indeed many kinds \n\n\nof feehng, as an ingredient of the will, so must we hkewise recognize \nthinking: in every act of will there is a commanding thought, and \nwe must not deceive ourselves that this thought can be separated \noff from ‘wilhng’, as if we would then have any will left over! \nThird, the will is not merely a complex of feehngs and thoughts, \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers 19 \nit is above all an emotion, and in fact the emotion of command. \nWhat is called ‘freedom of the will’ is essentially the emotion of \nsuperiority felt towards the one who must obey: ‘I am free, “he” \nmust obey.’ This consciousness hes in every will, as does also a \ntense alertness, a direct gaze concentrated on one thing alone, an \nunconditional assessment that ‘now we must have this and nothing \nelse’, an inner certainty that obedience will follow, and everything \nelse that goes along with the condition of giving commands. A \nperson who wills: this person is commanding a Something in \nhimself that obeys, or that he thinks is obeying. \nBut let us now consider the strangest thing about the will, about \nthis multifarious thing that the common people call by one word \nalone. In any given case, we both command and obey, and when \nwe obey we know the feehngs of coercion, pressure, oppression, \nresistance, and agitation that begin immediately after the act of \nwill. On the other hand, we are in the habit of ignoring or overlooking this division by means of the synthetic concept ‘I’. Thus, \na whole series of erroneous conclusions and therefore of false \nassessments of the will itself has been appended to wilhng in such \na way that the person who wills now believes with complete faith \nthat wilhng 7s enough for action. Because in the vast majority of \ncases, wilhng has only occurred when there is also the expectation \nthat the effect of the command—that is obedience, action—will \nfollow, this impression has been translated into the feehng that there \nis a necessary effect; suffice it to say, the person wilhng thinks with \nsome degree of certainty that will and action are somehow one: he \nattributes his success in carrying out his wilhng to the will itself \nand in this way enjoys an increase in that feehng of power that \naccompanies any kind of success. ‘Freedom of the will’—that is \nthe word for that complex pleasurable condition experienced by the \nperson wilhng who commands and simultaneously identifies himself \nwith the one who executes the command—as such he can share in \nenjoying a triumph over resistance, while secretly judging that it \nwas actually his will that overcame that resistance. Thus the person \nwilhng adds to his pleasurable feehng as commander the pleasurable \nfeehngs of the successful executing instrument, the serviceable \n‘underwill’ or under-soul (our body after all is nothing but a social \nstructure of many souls). L'effet c'est mot:* what is occurring here \noccurs in every well-structured happy community where the ruhng \n\n\n20 Beyond Good and Evil \nclass identifies with the successes of the community as a whole. As \nwe have said, every act of wilhng is simply a matter of commanding \nand obeying, based on a social structure of many ‘souls’; for this \nreason a philosopher should claim the right to comprehend wilhng \nfrom within the sphere of ethics: ethics, that is, understood as the \ntheory of hierarchical relationships among which the phenomenon \n‘life’ has its origins.",
        "Zimmern": "Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though \nit were the best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us to understand that the will alone is really \nknown to us, absolutely and completely known, without deduction or addition. But it again and again seems to me that \nin this case Schopenhauer also only did what philosophers are \nin the habit of doing — he seems to have adopted a popular \nprejudice and exaggerated it. Wilhng — seems to me to be \nabove all something complicated, something that is a unity \nonly in name — and it is precisely in a name that popular \nprejudice lurks, which has got the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages. So let us for \nonce be more cautious, let us be \"unphilosophical\": let us \nsay that in all wilhng there is firstly a plurahty of sensations, namely, the sensation of the condition \"away from \nwhich we go,\" the sensation of the condition \"towards which \nwe go,\" the sensation of this \"from\" and \"towards\" itself, \nand then besides, an accompanying muscular sensation, \nwhich, even without our putting in motion \"arms and legs,\" \ncommences its action by force of habit, directly we *'wiH\" \nanything. Therefore, just as sensations (and indeed many \nkinds of sensations) are to be recognised as ingredients of \nthe will, so, in the second place, thinking is also to be recognised; in every act of the will there is a ruhng thought; — \nand let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from \nthe \"wilhng,\" as if the will would then remain over! In the \n20 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nthird place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and \nthinking, but it is above all an emotion, and in fact the \nemotion of the command. That which is termed \"freedom \nof the will\" is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: \"I am free, 'he' must obey\" — \nthis consciousness is inherent in every will; and equally so \nthe straining of the attention, the straight look which fixes \nitself exclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment \nthat \"this and nothing else is necessary now,\" the inward \ncertainty that obedience will be rendered — and whatever else \npertains to the position of the commander. A man who wills \ncommands something within himself which renders obedience, \nor which he believes renders obedience. But now let us \nnotice what is the strangest thing about the will, — this affair \nso extremely complex, for which the people have only one \nname. Inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the \nsame time the commanding and the obeying parties, and as \nthe obe5dng party we know the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the \nother hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duahty, \nand to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic \nterm \"I\": a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false judgments about the will itself, has become attached to the act of wilhng — to such a degree that \nhe who wills believes firmly that wilhng suffices for action. \nSince fn the majority of cases there has only been exercise of \nwill when the effect of the command — consequently obedience, and therefore action — was to be expected, the appearance has translated itself into the sentiment, as if there were \na necessity of effect; in a word, he who wills believes with \na fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow \none; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the wilhng, \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 21 \nto the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success. \"Freedom of \nWill\" — that is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising vohtion, who commands and \nat the same time identifies himself with the executor of the \norder — who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, \nbut thinks within himself that it was really his own will \nthat overcame them.

The yeaming for ‘freedom of the will’ in the \nsuperlative metaphysical sense that unfortunately still prevails in \nthe minds of the half-educated, the yeaming to bear complete and \nfinal responsibility for one’s own actions and to relieve God, the \nworld, one’s ancestors, coincidence, society from it—this is really \nnothing less than being that same causa sui and, with a daring \ngreater than Miinchhausen’s,* dragging yourself by your hair out \nof the swamp of nothingness and into existence. Now, if someone \ncan see through the cloddish simplicity of this famous concept ‘free \nwill’ and ehminate it from his mind, I would then ask him to take \nhis ‘enlightenment’ a step further and hkewise ehminate from his \nhead the opposite of the non-concept ‘free will’: I mean the ‘unfree \nwil? which amounts to a misuse of cause and effect. One should \nnot make the mistake of concretizing ‘cause’ and ‘effect’? as do \nthe natural scientists (and whoever else today naturahzes in their \nthinking . . .), in conformity with the prevalent mechanistic foolishness that pushes and tugs at the cause until it ‘has an effect’; ‘cause’ \nand ‘effect’ should be used only as pure concepts, as conventional \nfictions for the purpose of description or communication, and \nnot for explanation. In the ‘in itself’ there is nothing of ‘causal \nassociations’, of ‘necessity’, of ‘psychological constraint’; the effect \ndoes not follow ‘upon the cause’, no ‘law’ govems it. We alone are \nthe ones who have invented causes, succession, reciprocity, relativity, coercion, number, law, freedom, reason, purpose; and if we \nproject, if we mix this world of signs into things as if it were an \n‘in itself’, we act once more as we have always done, that is, \nmythologically. The ‘unfree will’ is mythology: in real life it is only \na matter of strong and weak wills. \nWhenever a thinker sniffs out coercion, necessity, obhgation, \n22 Beyond Good and Evil \npressure, constraint in any ‘causal connection’ or ‘psychological \nnecessity’, it is almost always a symptom of where his own inadequacy hes: to feel this particular way is reveahng—the person is \nreveahng himself. And if I have observed correctly, the ‘constraint \nof the will is always conceived as a problem from two completely \nOpposite standpoints, but always in a profoundly personal way: the \none group will not hear of rehnquishing their ‘responsibility’, their \nbelief in themselves, their personal right to take ‘heir credit (the vain \nraces are of this type); conversely, the other group wants to be \nresponsible for nothing, guilty of nothing, and out of their inner \nself-contempt they yeam to cast off their own selves one way or \nanother. When this latter group writes books nowadays, they tend \nto take up the cause of criminals; a sort of sociahstic compassion \nis their nicest disguise. And indeed, it is surprising how much \nprettier the fatahsm of the weak-willed can look when it presents \nitself as ‘la religion de la souffrance humaine’;* that is what zt \nmeans by ‘good taste’.",

        "Kaufmann": "The causa sui is the best self-contradiction that has been \nconceived so far, it is a sort of rape and perversion of logic; but the \nextravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with just this nonsense. The desire for “free~ \ndom of the will” in the superlative metaphysical sense, which still \nholds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated; the \ndesire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one’s actions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, \nand society involves nothing less than to be precisely this causa sui \nand, with more than Münchhausen’s audacity, to pull oneself up \ninto existence by the hair, out of the swamps of nothingness.** Sup23 Cf. Sartre's famous dictum: “If man as the existentiahst sees him is not \ndefinable, it is because to begin with he is nothing. He will not be anything \nuntil later, and then he will be what he makes of himself. . . . Man simply \nis. Not that he is simply what he conceives himself to be, but he is what he \nwills . . . Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself, That \nis the first principle of existentiahsm. . . . Before that projection of the \nself nothing exists . .. Man is responsible for what he is. Thus, the first \neffect of existentiahsm is that it puts every man in possession of himself as \nhe is, and places the entire responsibility for his existence squarely upon his \nown shoulders” (“Existentiahsm Is a Humanism,” included in Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre, ed. Walter Kaufmann, pp. 290f.). \nReading this without knowing that Beyond Good and Evil was published \nin 1886 and Sartre's lecture in 1946, one would scarcely guess at Nietzsche's \nimmense influence on existentiahsm in general and Sartre in particular; one \nmight even suppose that Nietzsche was here polemicizing against Sartre, Cf, \nalso section 8 of “The Four Great Errors” in Twilight of the Idols (Portable Nietzsche, p. 500), where some imphcations of the above passage in \nBeyond Good and Evil are developed briefly, \nON THE PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS 29 \npose someone were thus to see through the boorish simplicity of this \ncelebrated concept of “free will” and put it out of his head altogether, I beg of him to carry his “enlightenment” a step further, and \nalso put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception \nof “free will”: I mean “unfree will,” which amounts to a misuse of \ncause and effect. One should not wrongly reify “cause” and “effect,” as the natural scientists do (and whoever, hke them, now \n“naturahzes” in his thinking), according to the prevaihng mechanical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until it “effects” its end; one should use “cause” and “effect” only as pure concepts, that is to say, as conventional fictions for the purpose of \ndesignation and communication—not for explanation. In the “initself” there is nothing of “causal connections,” of “necessity,” or of \n“psychological non-freedom”; there the effect does not follow the \ncause, there is no rule of “law.” It is we alone who have devised \ncause, sequence, for-each-other, relativity, constraint, number, \nlaw, freedom, motive, and purpose; and when we project and mix \nthis symbol world into things as if it existed “in itself,” we act \nonce more as we have always acted—mythologically. The “unfree \nwill” is mythology; in real life it is only a matter of strong and weak \nwills. \nIt is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself \nwhen a thinker senses in every “causal connection” and “psychological necessity” something of constraint, need, compulsion to \nobey, pressure, and unfreedom; it is suspicious to have such feehngs \n—the person betrays himself. And in general, if I have observed \ncorrectly, the “unfreedom of the will” is regarded as a problem \nfrom two entirely opposite standpoints, but always in a profoundly \npersonal manner: some will not give up their “responsibility,” their \nbelief in themselves, the personal right to their merits at any price \n(the vain races belong to this class). Others, on the contrary, do not \nwish to be answerable for anything, or blamed for anything, and \nowing to an inward self-contempt, seek to lay the blame for themselves somewhere else.

For the desire for \n‘freedom of will’ in that metaphysical superlative sense which is unfortunately still \ndominant in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the whole and sole \nresponsibility for one's actions and to absolve God, world, ancestors, chance, society \nfrom responsibility for them, is nothing less than the desire to be precisely that \ncausa sui and, with more than Miinchhausen temerity, to pull oneself into existence \nout of the swamp of nothingness by one's own hair. Assuming it is possible in this \nway to get beyond the peasant simplicity of this celebrated concept ‘free will’ and \nbanish it from one's mind, I would then ask whoever does that to carry his \n‘enlightenment’ a step further and also banish from his mind the contrary of that \nunnatural concept ‘free will’: I mean ‘unfree will’, which amounts to an abuse of \ncause and effect. One ought not to make ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ into material things, as \nnatural scientists do (and those who, hke them, naturahze in their thinking — ), in \naccordance with the prevaihng mechanistic stupidity which has the cause press and \npush until it ‘produces an effect’; one ought to employ ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ only as \npure concepts, that is to say as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation, \nmutual understanding, not explanation. In the ‘in itself’ there is nothing of ‘causal \nconnection’, of ‘necessity’, of ‘psychological unfreedom’; there ‘the effect’ does not \n‘follow the cause’, there no ‘law’ rules. It is we alone who have fabricated causes, \nsuccession, reciprocity, relativity, compulsion, number, law, freedom, motive, \npurpose; and when we falsely introduce this world of symbols into things and \nmingle it with them as though this symbol-world were an ‘in itself’, we once more \nbehave as we have always behaved, namely mythologically. ‘Unfree will’ is \n\n\nmythology: in real life it is only a question of strong and weak wills. — It is almost \nalways a symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker detects in every \n‘causal connection’ and ‘psychological necessity’ something of compulsion, \nexigency, constraint, pressure, unfreedom: such feehngs are traitors, the person who \nhas them gives himself away. And, if I have observed correctly, ‘unfreedom of will’ \nis in general conceived as a problem from two completely antithetical standpoints \nbut always in a profoundly personal manner: one will at no price give up his \n‘responsibility’, his belief in himself, the personal right to his deserts (the vain ra\nbelong here — ), the other, on the contrary, will not be responsible for anything, to \nblame for anything, and out of an inner self-contempt wants to be able to shift off \nhis responsibility for himself somewhere else. This latter, when he writes books, \ntends today to espouse the cause of the criminal; his most pleasing disguise is a kind \nof sociahst sympathy.

And yet even this hypothesis is \nfar from being the strangest and most painful in this tremendous, still almost \nunexplored realm of dangerous knowledge — and there are in fact a hundred good \nreasons why everyone should keep away from it who — can! On the other hand: if \nyour ship has been driven into these seas, very well! Now clench your teeth! Keep \nyour eyes open! Keep a firm hand on the helm! — We sail straight over morality and \npast it, we flatten, we crush perhaps what is left of our own morality by venturing to \nvoyage thither — but what do we matter! Never yet has a deeper world of insight \nrevealed itself to daring travellers and adventurers: and the psychologist who in this \nfashion ‘brings a sacrifice’ — it is not the sacrifizio dell'intelletto, on the contrar\nwill at least be entitled to demand in retum that psychology shall again be \nrecognized as the queen of the sciences, to serve and prepare for which the other \nsciences exist. For psychology is now once again the road to the fundamental \nproblems. \nPart Two: The Free Spirit",
        "Norman": "All psychology so far has been stuck in moral prejudices and fears: it has \nnot ventured into the depths. To grasp psychology as morphology and \nthe doctrine of the development of the mill to pomer, which 1s what I have \ndone — nobody has ever come close to this, not even in thought: this, \n\n\nof course, to the extent that we are permitted to regard what has been \nwritten so far as a symptom of what has not been said until now. The \npower of moral prejudice has deeply affected the most spiritual world, \nwhich seems hke the coldest world, the one most hkely to be devoid \nof any presuppositions — and the effect has been manifestly harmful, \nhindering, dazzhng, and distorting. A genuine physio-psychology has to \ncontend with unconscious resistances in the heart of the researcher, it \nhas “the heart\" against it. Even a doctrine of the reciprocal dependence \nof the “good” and the “bad” drives will (as a refined immorality) cause \ndistress and aversion in a strong and sturdy conscience — as will, to an even \ngreater extent, a doctrine of the derivation of all the good drives from the \nbad. But suppose somebody considers even the affects of hatred, envy, \ngreed, and power-lust as the conditioning affects of life, as elements that \nfundamentally and essentially need to be present in the total economy of \nlife, and consequently need to be enhanced where life is enhanced, — this \nperson will suffer from such a train of thought as if from sea-sickness. \nAnd yet even this hypothesis is far from being the most uncomfortable and \nunfamihar in this enormous, practically untouched realm of dangerous \nknowledge: — and there are hundreds of good reasons for people to keep \nout of it, if they — can! On the other hand, if you are ever cast loose \nhere with your ship, well now! come on! clench your teeth! open your \neyes! and grab hold of the helm! — we are saihng straight over and amay \nfrom morality; we are crushing and perhaps destroying the remnants of \nour own morality by daring to travel there — but what do me matter! \nNever before have intrepid voyagers and adventurers opened up a more",
        "Faber": "Until now, all psychology has been brought to a stop by moral \nprejudices and fears: it has not dared to plumb these depths. If we \nmay take previous writing as a symptom of what has also been \nsuppressed, then no one in his thoughts has even brushed these \ndepths as I have, as a morphology and evolutionary theory of the \nwill to power. The force of moral prejudices has reached far into \nthe most spiritual world, a world apparently cold and without \npremiss—and it has obviously had a harmful, inhibiting, blinding, \ndistorting effect. A real physio-psychology must struggle with the \nunconscious resistances in the heart of the researcher, the ‘heart’ \nis working against it; a conscience that is still strong and hearty \nwill be distressed and annoyed even by a theory of the reciprocal \nconditionahty of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ instincts, which seems to be a \nkind of subtle immorality—and even more by a theory of the \nderivation of all good drives from bad ones. But granted that a \nperson takes the emotions of hatred, envy, greed, power hunger as \nconditions for hving, crucial and fundamental to the universal \neconomy of life and therefore in need of intensifying if life is to be \nintensified, he is also a person who suffers from such an orientation \nin judgement as if he were seasick. And yet even this hypothesis is \nby no means the strangest or most painful one in this enormous, \nvirtually new realm of dangerous insights—and in truth there are \na hundred good reasons for everyone to stay away from it if he— \ncan! On the other hand, once your ship has strayed onto this course: \nwell then! All right! Grit your teeth bravely! Open your eyes! Keep \nyour hand at the helm!—we are going to be travelhng beyond \nmorality, and by daring to travel there we may in the process stifle \n24 Beyond Good and Evil \nor crush whatever remnant of morality we have left—but what do \nwe matter! Never yet has a deeper world of insight been opened to \nbold travellers and adventurers; and the psychologist who makes \nthis kind of ‘sacrifice’ (it is mot the sacrifizio dell’intelletto,* quite \nthe contrary!) may demand at least that psychology be recognized \nonce again as the queen of the sciences, which the other sciences \nexist to serve and anticipate. For psychology has once again become \nthe way to basic issues. \n\n\nSECTION TWO \nTHE FREE SPIRIT",
        "Zimmern": "All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and timidities, it has not dared to launch out into \nthe depths. In so far as it is allowable to recognise in that \n\n\n26 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nwhich has hitherto been written, evidence of that which has \nhitherto been kept silent, it seems as if nobody had yef \nharboured the notion of psychology as the Morphology and \nDevelopment-doctrine of the Will to Power, as I conceive \nof it. The power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply \nfnto the most intellectual world, the world apparently most \nindifferent and unprejudiced, and has obviously operated \nIn an injiuious, obstructive, blinding, and distorting manner. \nA proper physio-psychology has to contend with unconscious \nantagonism in the heart of the investigator, it has \"the \nheart\" against it: even a doctrine of the reciprocal conditionalness of the \"good\" and the \"bad\" impulses, causes (as \nrefined immorality) distress and aversion in a still strong \nand manly conscience — still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of all good impulses from bad ones. If, however, a \nperson should regard even the emotions of hatred, envy, \ncovetousness, and imperiousness as life-conditioning emotions, as factors which must be present, fundamentally and \nessentially, in the general economy of life (which must, therefore, be further developed if life is to be further developed), \nhe will suffer from such a view of things as from sea-sickness. \nAnd yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and \nmost painful in this immense and almost new domain of \ndangerous knowledge; and there are in fact a hundred good \nreasons why every one should keep away from it who can \ndo so! On the other hand, if one has once drifted hither \nwith one's bark, well! very good! now let us set our teeth \nfirmly! let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the \nhelm! We sail away right over morality, we crush out, we \ndestroy perhaps the remains of our own morality by daring \nto make our voyage thither — ^but what do we matter! Never \nyet did a projounder world of insight reveal itself to daring \ntravellers and adventurers, and the psychologist who thus \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 27 \n\"makes a sacrifice\" — it is not the sacrifizio dell' intelletto, \non the contrary! — will at least be entitled to demand in retum that psychology shall once more be recognised as the \nqueen of the sciences, for whose service and equipment the \nother sciences exist.

And pray, \n30 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \ndon't forget the garden, the garden with golden trelhs- work! \nAnd have people around you who are as a garden — or as \nmusic on the waters at eventide, when already the day becomes a memory. Choose the good sohtude, the free, wanton, lightsome sohtude, which also gives you the right still \nto remain good in any sense whatsoever! How poisonous, \nhow crafty, how bad, does every long war make one, which \ncannot be waged openly by means of force! How personal \ndoes a long fear make one, a long watching of enemies, of \npossible enemies! These pariahs of society, these longpursued, badly-persecuted ones — also the compulsory recluses, the Spinozas or Giordano Brunos — always become \nin the end, even under the most intellectual masquerade, and \nperhaps without being themselves aware of it, refined vengeance-seekers and poison-brewers (just lay bare the foundation of Spinoza's ethics and theology!), not to speak of the \nstupidity of moral indignation, which is the unfaihng sign \nin a philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour \nhas left him. The martyrdom of the philosopher, his \"sacrifice for the sake of truth,\" forces into the light whatever of \nthe agitator and actor lurks in him; and if one has hitherto \ncontemplated him only with artistic curiosity, with regard \nto many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous \ndesire to see him also in his deterioration (deteriorated into a \n\"martyr,\" into a stage- and tribune-bawler) . Only, that it \nis necessary with such a desire to be clear what spectacle \none will see in any case — merely a satyric play, merely an \n\n\nepilogue farce, merely the continued proof that the long, real \ntragedy is at an end, supposing that every philosophy has \nbeen a long tragedy in its origin. \nf 1 \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 31"

        "Kaufmann": "Every choice human being strives instinctively for a citadel \nand a secrecy where he is saved from the crowd, the many, the \ngreat majority—-where he may forget “men who are the rule,” being their exception—excepting only the one case in which he is \npushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct, as a seeker \nafter knowledge in the preat and exceptional sense. Anyone who, \nin intercourse with men, does not occasionally ghsten in all the \ncolors of distress, green and gray with disgust, satiety, sympathy, \ngloominess, and lonehness, is certainly not a man of elevated \ntastes; supposing, however, that he does not take all this burden \nand disgust upon himself voluntarily, that he persistently avoids it, \nand remains, as I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, \none thing is certain: he was not made, he was not predestined, for \nknowledge. If he were, he would one day have to say to himself: \n“The devil take my good taste! but the rule is more interesting than \nthe exception—than myself, the exception!” And he would go \ndown, and above all, he would go “inside.” \n5 An echo of the Prologue to Zarathustra. \n38 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nThe long and serious study of the average man, and consequently much disguise, self-overcoming, famiharity, and bad contact (all contact is bad contact except with one’s equals) —this \nconstitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every philosopher, \nperhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and disappointing part. If \nhe is fortunate, however, as a favorite child of knowledge should \nbe, he will encounter suitable shortcuts and helps for his task; I \nmean so-called cynics, those who simply recognize the animal, the \ncommonplace, and “the rule” in themselves, and at the same time \nstill have that degree of spirituality and that itch which makes them \ntalk of themselves and their hkes before witnesses—sometimes \nthey even wallow in books, as on their own dung. \nCynicism is the only form in which base souls approach honesty; and the higher man must hsten closely to every coarse or subtle cynicism, and congratulate himself when a clown without shame \nor a scientific satyr speaks out precisely in front of him. \nThere are even cases where enchantment mixes with the disgust—namely, where by a freak of nature genius is tied to some \nsuch indiscreet billygoat and ape, as in the case of the Abbé Gahani,® the profoundest, most clear-sighted, and perhaps also filthiest \nman of his century—he was far profounder than Voltaire and consequently also a good deal more tacitum. It happens more frequently, as has been hinted, that a scientific head is placed on an \nape’s body, a subtle exceptional understanding in a base soul, an \noccurrence by no means rare, especially among doctors and physiologists of morality. And whenever anyone speaks without bitterness, quite innocently, of man as a belly with two requirements, \nand a head with one; whenever anyone sees, seeks, and wants to \nsee only hunger, sexual lust, and vanity as the real and only mo8 Abbé Ferdinand Gahani (1728-87) is characterized in The Oxford Companion to French Literature (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1959) as “a Nea» \npohtan, of diminutive size, secretary at the embassy in Paris from 1759 . . . \nof considerable leaming and originality of views, somewhat of a buffoon, \nmuch appreciated in the hterary and philosophical society of the day... \nHis Dialogues sur les blés, a work remarkable for lively wit as well as force \nof argument, combating the doctrines of the more extreme physiocrats, appeared in 1770, after his departure from Paris in 1769.” His letters to Mme \nd’Epinay, Mme Geoffrin, and Mme Necker have also been published, \nTHE FREE SPIRIT 39 \ntives of human actions; in short, when anyone speaks “badly”— \nand not even “wickedly”—of man, the lover of knowledge should \nhsten subtly and dihgently; he should altogether have an open ear \nwherever people talk without indignation. For the indignant and \nwhoever perpetually tears and lacerates with his own teeth himself (or as a substitute, the world, or God, or society) may indeed, \nmorally speaking, stand higher than the laughing and self-satisfied \nsatyr, but in every other sense they are a more ordinary, more indifferent, and less instructive case. And no one hes as much as the \nindignant do.",
        "Hollingdale": "Every superior human being will instinctively aspire after a secret citadel where he \nis set free from the crowd, the many, the majority, where, as its exception, he may \nforget the rule ‘man’ — except in the one case in which, as a man of knowledge in \nthe great and exceptional sense, he will be impelled by an even stronger instinct to \nmake straight for this rule. He who, when trafficking with men, does not \noccasionally ghsten with all the shades of distress, green and grey with disgust, \nsatiety, sympathy, gloom and lonehness, is certainly not a man of an elevated taste; \nbut if he does not voluntarily assume this burden and displeasure, if he continually \navoids it and, as aforesaid, remains hidden quietly and proudly away in his citadel, \nthen one thing is sure: he is not made, not predestined for knowledge. For if he \nwere, he would one day have to say to himself: “The devil can take my good taste! \nthe rule is more interesting than the exception — than I, the exception!’ — and would \ngo down, would above all ‘go in’. The study of the average human being, protracted, \nserious, and with much dissembhng, self-overcoming, intimacy, bad company — all \ncompany is bad company except the company of one's equals — : this constitutes a \nnecessary part of the life story of every philosopher, perhaps the most unpleasant \nand malodorous part and the part most full of disappointments. If he is lucky, \nhowever, as a favourite child of knowledge ought to be, he will encounter means of \nfacihtating and cutting short his task — I mean so-called cynics, that is to say peopl\nwho recognize the animal, the commonness, the ‘rule’ in themselves and yet still \npossess a degree of spirituality and appetite which constrains them to speak of \nthemselves and their kind before witnesses — sometimes they even wallow in books \nas in their own dung. Cynicism is the only form in which common souls come close \nto honesty; and the higher man must prick up his ears at every cynicism, whether \ncoarse or refined, and congratulate himself whenever a buffoon without shame or a \nscientific satyr speaks out in his presence. There are even cases in which fascination \nmingles with the disgust: namely where, by a caprice of nature, such an indiscreet \ngoat and monkey is touched with genius, as in the case of the Abbé Gahani, the \nprofoundest, most sharp-sighted and perhaps also dirtiest man of his century — he \nwas far more profound than Voltaire and consequently also a good deal more silent. \nIt is more often the case that, as already indicated, a scientific head is set on a \nmonkey's body, a refined exceptional understanding on a common soul — no rare \noccurrence, for instance, among physicians and moral physiologists. And whenever \nanyone speaks, without bittemess, rather innocuously, of man as a belly with two \nneeds and a head with one; wherever anyone sees, seeks and wants to see only \nhunger, sexual desire, and vanity, as though these were the actual and sole motives \nof human actions; in brief, whenever anyone speaks ‘badly’ of man — but does not \nspeak ill of him — the lover of knowledge should hsten carefully and with dihgence, \nand he should in general lend an ear whenever anyone speaks without indignation. \n\n\nFor the indignant man, and whoever is continually tearing and rending himself with \nhis teeth (or, instead of himself, the world, or God, or society) may indeed morally \nspeaking stand higher than the laughing and self-satisfied satyr, but in every other \nsense he is the more commonplace, less interesting, less instructive case. And no \none hes so much as the indignant man. —",
        "Norman": "vengeance and mixing their poisons (just try digging up the foundation \nof Spinoza’s ethics and theology!). Not to mention the absurd spectacle of \nmoral indignation, which is an unmistakable sign that a philosopher has \nlost his philosophical sense of humor. 'T'he philosopher's martyrdom, his \n“self-sacrifice for the truth,” brings to light the agitator and actor in him; \nand since we have only ever regarded him with artistic curiosity, it is easy \nto understand the dangerous wish to see many of these philosophers in \ntheir degeneration for once (degenerated into *martyrs\" or loud-mouths \n\n\non their stage or soap-box). It's just that, with this sort of wish we have to \nbe clear about what we will be seeing: — only a satyr-play, only a satirical \nepilogue, only the continuing proof that the long, real tragedy has come to \nan end (assuming that every philosophy was originally a long tragedy — ).",
        "Faber": "Every exceptional person instinctively seeks out his fortress, his \nsecrecy, where he is delivered from the crowd, the multitude, the \nmajority, where he is allowed to forget the rule of ‘humanity’, being \nthe exception to it; in one case, however, an even stronger instinct \npushes him, as a person of great and exceptional knowledge, towards \nthis rule. Anyone who interacts with other people without occasionally displaying all the colours of distress (green and grey with \ndisgust, annoyance, compassion, gloom, lonehness) is surely not a \nman of higher taste; but if on the other hand he declines to assume \nthis whole dispiriting burden and keeps evading it by remaining, \nas described above, tucked away peaceful and proud in his fortress, \nthen one thing is certain: he is not made for, not destined for, \nknowledge. For if he were, he would some day have to say to \nhimself, ‘To hell with my good taste! The rule is more interesting \nthan the exception, more interesting than I, the exception!’—and \nhe would go down, and above all, go ‘into’. The study of the average \nman is a long, serious study, requiring much in the way of disguise, \nself-disciphne, intimacy, bad company (every company is bad \ncompany except that of one’s equals); it makes up a necessary \npart of every philosopher’s biography, and it is perhaps the most \nunpleasant, worst-smelhng part, most rife with disappointment. \nBut if he has the good fortune that befits a fortunate child of \nknowledge, he will encounter others who in fact shorten and lighten \nhis task: I mean the so-called cynics, those people who simply \nacknowledge what is animal-hke, common, the ‘rule’ about themselves and yet still have enough spirituality and excitabihty to need \nto speak about themselves and their kind in front of witnesses— \nsometimes these people even wallow around in books, as in their \nown mire. It is only in the form of cynicism that common souls \n28 Beyond Good and Evil \ncome near to being honest; and the higher man must open his ears \nto every kind of cynicism, whether crude or subtle, and must \ncongratulate himself whenever he is lucky enough to hear a shameless joker or scholarly satyr raise his voice. There are even cases \nthat mix enchantment with the disgust, when a whim of nature \njoins genius to such a prying goat and ape, as in the case of the \nAbbé Gahani,* the most profound, acute, and perhaps dirtiest man \nof his century—he was much more profound than Voltaire and \ntherefore a good deal more tacitum. As I suggested, it is more \ncommon that the scholarly head is set upon an ape’s body, a subtle \nexceptional mind above a common heart—with doctors and the \nphysiologists of morality we find it especially often. And whenever \nsomeone speaks about human beings not bitterly, but neutrally, as \nif he were talking about a belly with two different needs and a head \n\n\nwith but one; whenever someone sees, looks for, and mants to see \nonly hunger, sexual desire, and vanity, as if these were the only \ntrue motives for human behaviour; whenever, in short, someone \nspeaks ‘badly’ about human beings (and not even smicked/y), then \nthe lover of knowledge must pay close and careful attention—he \nmust keep his ears open in general, whenever people speak without \nindignation. For the indignant man and whoever else uses his own \nteeth to mutilate and dismember himself (or God or society in \nplace of himself) may stand higher than the laughing and selfsatisfied satyr in moral terms, but in every other sense he represents \nthe more common, more inconsequential, more uninstructive case. \nAnd only the indignant tell so many /ies—",

Wer endhch dürfte gar eine\ndeutsche Übersetzung des Petronius wagen, der, mehr als irgend ein\ngrosser Musiker bisher, der Meister des presto gewesen ist, in\nErfindungen, Einfällen, Worten: - was hegt zuletzt an allen Sümpfen\nder kranken, schhmmen Welt, auch der \"alten Welt\", wenn man, wie er,\ndie Füsse eines Windes hat, den Zug und Athem, den befreienden Hohn\neines Windes, der Alles gesund macht, indem er Alles laufen macht! Und\nwas Aristophanes angeht, jenen verklärenden, complementären Geist, um\ndessentwillen man dem ganzen Griechenthum verzeiht, dass es da war,\ngesetzt, dass man in aller Tiefe begriffen hat, was da Alles der\nVerzeihung, der Verklärung bedarf: - so wüsste ich nichts, was mich\nüber Plato's Verborgenheit und Sphinx-Natur mehr hat träumen lassen\nals jenes glückhch erhaltene petit falt: dass man unter dem\nKopfkissen seines Sterbelagers keine \"Bibel\" vorfand, nichts\nÄgyptisches, Pythagoreisches, Platonisches, - sondem den\nAristophanes.

Germans are almost incapable of a presto in their language: and so it is easy to see that they are incapable of many of the most delightful and daring nuances of free, free-spirited thought. Since the buffo and the satyr are alien to the German in body and in conscience, Aristophanes and Petronius are as good as untranslatable.

That which \nserves the higher class of men for nourishment or refreshment, must be almost poison to an entirely different and \nlower order of human beings. The virtues of the common \nman would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher; it might be possible for a highly developed man, \nsupposing him to degenerate and go to ruin, to acquire \nquahties thereby alone, for the sake of which he would have \nto be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which he \nhad sunk. There are books which have an inverse value for \nthe soul and the health according as the inferior soul and \nthe lower vitahty, or the higher and more powerful, make \nuse of them. In the former case they are dangerous, disturbing, unsetthng books, in the latter case they are heraldcalls which summon the bravest to their bravery. Books \nfor the general reader are always ill-smelhng books, the \nodour of paltry people chngs to them. Where the populace \neat and drink, and even where they reverence, it is accustomed to stink.

In allem Emste: die Unschuld der Denker hat etwas\nRührendes und Ehrfurcht Einflössendes, welche ihnen erlaubt, sich auch\nheute noch vor das Bewusstsein hinzustellen, mit der Bitte, dass es\nihnen ehrhche Antworten gebe: zum Beispiel ob es \"real\" sei, und\nwarum es eigenthch die äussere Welt sich so entschlossen vom\nHalse halte, und was dergleichen Fragen mehr sind. Der Glaube an\n\"unmittelbare Gewissheiten\" ist eine morahsche Naivetät, welche\n\nuns Philosophen Ehre macht: aber - wir sollen nun einmal nicht \"nur\nmorahsche\" Menschen sein! Von der Moral abgesehn, ist jener Glaube\neine Dummheit, die uns wenig Ehre macht! Mag im bürgerhchen Leben das\nallzeit bereite Misstrauen als Zeichen des \"schlechten Charakters\"\ngelten und folghch unter die Unklugheiten gehören: hier unter uns,\njenseits der bürgerhchen Welt und ihres Ja's und Nein's, - was sollte\nuns hindem, unklug zu sein und zu sagen: der Philosoph hat nachgerade\nein Recht auf \"schlechten Charakter\", als das Wesen, welches bisher\nauf Erden immer am besten genarrt worden ist, - er hat heute die\nPfhcht zum Misstrauen, zum boshaftesten Schielen aus jedem Abgrunde\ndes Verdachts heraus. - Man vergebe mir den Scherz dieser düsteren\nFratze und Wendung: denn ich selbst gerade habe längst über Betrügen\nund Betrogenwerden anders denken, anders schätzen gelemt und halte\nmindestens ein paar Rippenstösse für die blinde Wuth bereit, mit der\ndie Philosophen sich dagegen sträuben, betrogen zu werden. Warum\nnicht? Es ist nicht mehr als ein morahsches Vorurtheil, dass Wahrheit\nmehr werth ist als Schein; es ist sogar die schlechtest bewiesene\nAnnahme, die es in der Welt giebt. Man gestehe sich doch so viel ein:\nes bestünde gar kein Leben, wenn nicht auf dem Grunde perspektivischer\nSchätzungen und Scheinbarkeiten; und wollte man, mit der tugendhaften\nBegeisterung und Tölpelei mancher Philosophen, die \"scheinbare\nWelt\" ganz abschlaffen, nun, gesetzt, ihr könntet das, - so bhebe\nmindestens dabei auch von eurer \"Wahrheit\" nichts mehr übrig! Ja,\nwas zwingt uns überhaupt zur Annahme, dass es einen wesenhaften\nGegensatz von \"wahr\" und \"falsch\" giebt? Genügt es nicht, Stufen der\nScheinbarkeit anzunehmen und gleichsam hellere und dunklere Schatten\nund Gesammttöne des Scheins, - verschiedene valeurs, um die Sprache\nder Maler zu reden? Warum dürfte die Welt, die uns etwas angeht -,\nnicht eine Fiktion sein?

Ist es\ndenn nicht erlaubt, gegen Subjekt, wie gegen Prädikat und Objekt,\nnachgerade ein Wenig ironisch zu sein? Dürfte sich der Philosoph nicht\nüber die Gläubigkeit an die Grammatik erheben?

Hasn't it played the biggest joke on us to date? And what \nguarantee would there be that it wouldn't keep doing what it has always \ndone? In all seriousness, there is something touching and awe-inspiring \nabout the innocence that, to this day, lets a thinker place himself in front \nof consciousness with the request that it please give him /onest answers: \nfor example, whether or not it is “real,” and why it so resolutely keeps \nthe extemal world at arm's length, and other questions hke that.

        "Faber": "No matter what philosophical standpoint we may take these days, \nlooking out from any position, the erroneousness of the world we \nthink we are hving in is the most certain and concrete thing our \neyes can fasten on: we find a host of reasons for it, reasons that \nmight tempt us to speculate about a deceptive principle in the \n‘nature of things’.

And what guarantce would we have that it \nwouldn’t go on doing what it has always done? In all seriousness, \nthere is something touching and awe-inspiring in the innocence of \nthinkers that allows them even nowadays to request honest answers \nfrom their consciousness: about whether it is ‘substantial’, for \nexample, or why it insists on keeping the outside world at such a \ndistance, and all sorts of other questions of that kind. The faith in \n‘immediate certainties’ is morally naive, and does honour to us \nphilosophers, but—we are not supposed to be ‘on/y moral’ after \nall!

Why not? It is nothing but a moral prejudice \nto consider truth more valuable than appearance; it is, in fact, the \nThe Free Spirit 35 \nmost poorly proven assumption in the world. We should admit at \nleast this much: there would be no life at all if not on the basis of \nperspectivist assessments and appearances; and if one wanted to do \naway with the ‘apparent world’ entirely, as some vahantly enthusiastic and foolish philosophers want to do, well then, assuming that \npeople hke you could do that—then at the very least there would \nbe nothing left of your ‘truth’, either! Really, why should we be \nforced to assume that there is an essential difference between ‘true’ \nand ‘false’ in the first place? Isn’t it enough to assume that there \nare degrees of apparency and, so to speak, lighter and darker \nshadows and hues of appearance—different valeurs,* to use the \nlanguage of painters? Why should the world that is relevant to us \nnot be a fiction? And if someone asks, ‘But mustn’t a fiction have \nan author?’ shouldn’t we answer him bluntly, ‘Why? Mustn’t this \n‘mustn’t’ be part of the fiction, too, perhaps? Aren’t we allowed to \nbe a httle bit ironic, not only about predicates and objects, but also \nabout subjects? Shouldn’t the philosopher be able to rise above a \nfaith in grammar? My respects to govemesses, but isn’t it about \ntime that philosophers renounced the religion of govemesses?",

In the end, the question is \nwhether we really recognize will as efficient, whether we believe in the causahty of \nwill: if we do so — and fundamentally belief in this is precisely our belief in \ncausahty itself — then we have to make the experiment of positing causahty of will \nhypothetically as the only one. ‘Will’ can of course operate only on ‘will’ — and not \non ‘matter’ (not on ‘nerves’, for example —): enough, one must venture the \nhypothesis that wherever ‘effects’ are recognized, will is operating upon will — and \nthat all mechanical occurrences, in so far as a force is active in them, are force of \nwill, effects of will. — Granted finally that one succeeded in explaining our entire \ninstinctual life as the development and ramification of one basic form of will — as \nwill to power, as is my theory — ; granted that one could trace all organic functions \nback to this will to power and could also find in it the solution to the problem of \nprocreation and nourishment — they are one problem — one would have acquired the \nright to define all efficient force unequivocally as: will to power.

I do not mean the material world \nas a delusion, as ‘appearance’ or ‘representation’ (in the Berkeleian \nor Schopenhauerian sense), but rather as a world with the same \n\n\nlevel of reality that our emotion has—that is, as a more rudimentary \nform of the world of emotions, holding everything in a powerful \n36 Beyond Good and Evil \nunity, all the potential of the organic process to develop and differentiate (and spoil and weaken, too, of course), as a kind of instinctual \nlife in which all the organic functions (self-regulation, adaptation, \nahmentation, ehmination, metabohsm) are synthetically hnked to \none another—as a prehminary form of life? \nIn the end, we are not only allowed to perform such an experiment, we are commanded to do so by the conscience of our method. \nWe must not assume that there are several sorts of causahty until \nwe have tested the possibility that one alone will suffice, tested it \nto its furthest limits (to the point of nonsense, if you'll allow me to \nsay so). We cannot evade this morality of method today: it follows \n‘by definition’, as a mathematician would say. The question is \nultimately whether we really recognize that the will can effect things, \nwhether we believe in the causahty of the will: if we do (and to \nbelieve in this is basically to believe in causahty itself), we must \nexperiment to test hypothetically whether the causahty of the will \nis the only causahty. A ‘will can have an effect only upon another \n‘will, of course, and not upon ‘matter’ (not upon ‘nerves’, for \nexample): one must dare to hypothesize, in short, that wherever \n‘effects’ are identified, a will is having an effect upon another will— \nand that all mechanical events, in so far as an energy is active in \nthem, are really the energy of the will, the effect of the will. \nAssuming, finally, that we could explain our entire instinctual \nlife as the development and differentiation of one basic form of the \nwill (namely the will to power, as my tenet would have it); assuming \nthat one could derive all organic functions from this will to power \nand also find in it the solution to the problem of procreation and \nahmentation (it is all one problem), then we would have won the \nright to designate all effective energy unequivocally as: the will to \npower.

But \nin section 47 Nietzsche speaks of “the religious neurosis—or what I call \n‘das rehgiöse Wesen’ ”; and this puts one in mind of contexts in which \nWesen means character, conduct, manners, airs, and even ado: viel Wesen \nmeans much ado. Finanzwesen means financial affairs, or the financial establishment, or finunces. Bankwesen, banks or banking in general; Minenwesen, mining; and Kriegswesen, mihtary art—these last examples come \nfrom a dictionary.",

But in saying this I feel I have a duty, \nalmost as much towards them as towards us, their heralds and precursors, us free \nspirits! — to blow away from all of us an ancient and stupid prejudice and \nmisunderstanding which has all too long obscured the concept ‘free spirit’ hke a fog. \nIn all the countries of Europe and hkewise in America there exists at present \nsomething that misuses this name, a very narrow, enclosed, chained up species of \nspirits who desire practically the opposite of that which informs our aims and \ninstincts — not to mention the fact that in regard to those new philosophers \nappearing they must certainly be closed windows and bolted doors.

But in saying this, I feel even towards them (as \ntowards ourselves, the free spirits who are their heralds and \nforerunners!) the obhgation to dispel for both of us a stupid old \nprejudice and misunderstanding that for all too long has \nenshrouded the concept ‘free spirit’ hke a fog. In all the countries \nof Europe and in America now as well, there is something that is \nmisusing this name: a very narrow, trapped, enchained sort of spirit \nwho wants more or less the opposite of what we do, by instinct \nand intention—not to mention that they are bound to be the shut \nwindows and barred doors to those approaching new philosophers. \nThese falsely dubbed ‘free spirits’ belong, short and sour, to the \nlevellers, loquacious scribbhng slaves of the democratic taste and its \n‘modem ideas’: they are all of them people without sohtude, \nwithout their own sohtude, plain well-behaved lads whose courage \nThe Free Spirit 41 \nand honourable propriety cannot be denied.

What they are trying with all their \nstrength to achieve is a common green pasture of happiness for the \nherd, with safety, security, comfort, ease of life for everyone; their \ntwo most often recited tunes and teachings are ‘Equal rights’ and \n‘Compassion for all suffering-—and they take suffering itself as \n\n\nsomething that must be ehminated. \nWe who are the opposite, who have opened an eye and a conscience to the question of where and how the plant ‘human being’ \nhas most vigorously grown tall, we are of the opinion that this has \nalways happened under the opposite conditions: that the precariousness of the plant’s situation had first to increase enormously; that \nits power of invention and disguise (its ‘spirit-—) had to become \nsubtle and daring through long periods of pressure and disciphne; \nthat its life-will had to be intensified into an unconditional powerwill.

Is it any surprise that we ‘free \nspirits’ are not the most communicative of spirits? That we do not \nwish to reveal in every case what a spirit can hberate itself from \nand what it may then perhaps be driven to? And as far as concems \nthe dangerous phrase ‘beyond good and evil’, it guards us at least \nagainst being misidentified: we are something other than ‘hbrepenseurs’, ‘hberi pensatori’, ‘freethinkers’,* and whatever other \nnames all these honourable advocates of ‘modem ideas’ might \nchoose to call themselves by.

It seemed palpable that a “bad man” was suddenly \ntransformed into a “saint,” a good man. The psychology we have \nhad so far suffered shipwreck at this point: wasn’t this chiefly because it had placed itself under the dominion of morals, because it, \ntoo, believed in opposite moral values and saw, read, interpreted \nthese opposites into the text and the facts? \nWhat?

The \njustification of the latter doubt is that one of the most frequent symptoms of the \ncondition, in the case of savage and tame peoples, is the most sudden and most \nextravagant voluptuousness which is then, just as suddenly, reversed into a \nconvulsion of penitence and a denial of world and will: both perhaps interpretable \nas masked epilepsy? But nowhere is it more necessary to renounce interpretations: \naround no other type has there grown up such an abundance of nonsense and \nsuperstition, none seems to have hitherto interested men, even philosophers, more — \nthe time has come to cool down a httle on this matter, to leam caution: better, to \nlook away, to go away. — Still in the background of the most recent philosophy, the \nSchopenhaueran, there stands, almost as the problem in itself, this gruesome \nquestion-mark of the religious crisis and awakening.

Pschology has hitherto come to \ngrief at this point: has it not been principally because it has acknowledged the \ndominion of morality, because it itself believed in antithetical moral values and saw, \nread, interpreted these antitheses into the text and the facts? — What?

This \nlast doubt seems justified by the fact that another one of the most regular \nsymptoms of the religious neurosis, in both wild and tame peoples, is the \nmost sudden and dissipated display of voluptuousness, which then tums \njust as suddenly into spasms of repentance and negations of the world \nand will: perhaps both can be interpreted as epilepsy in disguise?

        "Faber": "Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on earth until now, \nwe find it combined with three dangerous dietetic prescriptions: \nsohtude, fasting, and sexual abstinence—though it is impossible to \ndecide with certainty which is the cause, which the effect, and \nwhether in fact there is a cause-and-effect relationship at all. This \nlast doubt is justified if we consider that one of the most regular \nsymptoms of religious neurosis in both savage and civihzed peoples \nis a sudden, extravagant voluptuousness, which just as suddenly \ntums into spasms of penitence and a denial of the world and the \nwill; both perhaps to be interpreted as a disguised form of epilepsy? \nIn no area, however, should one be so ready to dismiss interpretations as here: no other archetype has given rise to such a wealth \nof nonsense and superstition, or held greater interest for people, \neven philosophers—this might be the right time to cool down, to \nleam caution, or even better: to look away, to go away. \nEven behind the most recent philosophy—Schopenhauer’s— \nthere still hes what is virtually the key problem, this terrifying \nquestion mark of religious crisis and religious awakening. How is \nthe denial of the will possible? How is sainthood possible? That really \ndoes seem to be the question that first concemed Schopenhauer \nand made him into a philosopher. And so it was a genuinely \nSchopenhauerian consequence that his most convinced disciple \n(perhaps his last one, too, in Germany at least), Richard Wagner \nby name, should have brought his own life’s work to a conclusion \nat just this point, introducing that terrible and etemal archetype to \nthe stage as Kundry,* type vécu,* in the hving flesh; at the same \ntime psychiatrists from nearly all the countries in Europe had \nopportunity to study the type at close quarters, wherever the most \nrecent epidemic of the religious neurosis—or, as I call it, the \nreligious disposition—broke out and marched forth in the guise of \nthe ‘Salvation Army’. \nIf we wonder what it is that all kinds of people at all times, even \n46 Beyond Good and Evil \n\n\nphilosophers, have continued to find so interesting in the whole \nphenomenon of the saint, the answer is surely its seeming miraculousness, the immediate succession of opposites, of conditions of the \nsoul with opposite moral value: here it seemed palpable that a ‘bad \nperson’ could all at once tum into a ‘saint’, a good person. This is \nwhere earher psychology ran aground: was it not chiefly because it \nhad submitted to the rule of morality, itself beheving in moral value \noppositions and seeing, reading, interpreting these oppositions into \nthe text and facts of the case?— \nWhat’s that? A ‘miracle’ may be only an interpretative error? A \nphilological failure?",
        "Zimmern": "Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth \nso far, we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen: sohtude, fasting, and sexual abstinence \n— but without its being possible to determine with certainty \nwhich is cause and which is effect, or if any relation at all of \ncause and effect exists there. This latter doubt is justified \nby the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among \nsavage as well as among civihsed peoples is the most sudden \nand excessive sensuality; which then with equal suddenness \ntransforms into penitential paroxysms, world-renunciation, \nand will-renunciation: both symptoms perhaps explainable \nas disguised epilepsy? But nowhere is it more obhgatory \nto put aside explanations: around no other type has there \ngrown such a mass of absurdity and superstition, no other \ntype seems to have been more interesting to men and even to \nphilosophers — perhaps it is time to become just a httle indifferent here, to leam caution, or, better still, to look away,. \nto go away. — Yet in the background of the most recent \nphilosophy, that of Schopenhauer, we find almost as the \n■roblem in itself, this terrible note of interrogation of the \ntehgious crisis and awakening. How is the negation of will \n^ssible? how is the saint possible? — that seems to have been \n■le very question with which Schopenhauer made a start \nand became a philosopher. And thus it was a genuine \nichopenhauerian consequence, that his most convinced adent (perhaps also his last, as far as Germany is coned), namely, Richard Wagner, should bring his ovm \nwork to an end just here, and should finally put that \nible and etemal type upon the stage as Kundry, type \nu, and as it loved and lived, at the very time that the \n\n\n56 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nmad-doctors in almost all European countries had an opportunity to study the type close at hand, wherever the religious neurosis — or as I call it, \"the religious mood\" — made \nits latest epidemical outbreak and display as the \"Salvation \nArmy.\" — If it be a question, however, as to what has been \nso extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages, and \neven to philosophers, in the whole phenomenon of the saint, \nit is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein \n— ^namely, the immediate succession of opposites, of states \nof the soul regarded as morally antithetical: it was believed \nhere to be self-evident that a \"bad man\" was all at once \ntumed into a \"saint,\" a good man. The hitherto existing \npsychology was wrecked at this point; is it not possible it \nmay have happened principally because psychology had \nplaced itself under the dominion of morals, because it believed in oppositions of moral values, and saw, read, and \ninterpreted these oppositions into the text and facts of the \ncase? What? \"Miracle\" only an error of interpretation? \nA lack of philology?"
