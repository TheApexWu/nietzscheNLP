Is it any wonder we should at last grow distrustful, lose our \npatience, tum impatiently away? That this sphinx should teach us too to ask \nquestions? Who really is it that here questions us? What really is it in us that wants \n‘the truth’? — We did indeed pause for a long time before the question of the origin \nof this will — until finally we came to a complete halt before an even more \nfundamental question. We asked after the value of this will. Granted we want truth: \n\n\nwhy not rather untruth? And uncertainty?

With all the value that \nmay adhere to the true, the genuine, the selfless, it could be possible that a higher \nand more fundamental value for all hfe might have to be ascribed to appearance, to \nthe will to deception, to selfishness and to appetite. It might even be possible that \nwhat constitutes the value of those good and honoured things resides precisely in \ntheir being artfully related, knotted and crocheted to these wicked, apparently \nantithetical things, perhaps even in their being essentially identical with them. \nPerhaps! — But who is wilhng to concem himself with such dangerous perhapses! \nFor that we have to await the arrival of a new species of philosopher, one which \npossesses tastes and inchnations opposite to and different from those of its \npredecessors — philosophers of the dangerous ‘perhaps’ in every sense. — And to \nspeak in all seriousness: I see such new philosophers arising."

      "text": "It seems to me that there is today an effort going on everywhere to distract attention \nfrom the actual influence exercised on German philosophy by Kant and, in \nparticular, prudently to gloss over the value he set upon himself. Kant was first and \nforemost proud of his table of categories; with this table in his hand he said: “This i\nthe hardest thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.’ — But let \nus understand this ‘could be’! He was proud of having discovered a new faculty in \nman, the faculty of synthetic judgements a priori. Granted he deceived himself in \nthis: the evolution and rapid burgeoning of German philosophy none the less \ndepended on this pride of his and on the eager rivalry of the whole younger \ngeneration to discover, if possible, something of which to be still prouder — and in \nany event ‘new faculties’! — But let us stop and reflect: it is time we did so. Kant \nasked himself: how are synthetic judgements a priori possible? — and what, really, \ndid he answer? By means of a faculty: but unfortunately not in a few words, but so \ncircumspectly, venerably, and with such an expenditure of German profundity and \nflourishes that the comical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer was \noverlooked. People even lost their heads altogether on account of this new faculty, \nand the rejoicing reached its chmax when Kant went on further to discover a moral \nfaculty in man — for at that time the Germans were still moral and by no means \npractitioners of Realpohtik. — The honeymoon time of German philosophy arrived; \nand the young theologians of the College of Tiibingen went straightway off into the \nbushes — all in search of ‘faculties’. And what did they not find — in that innocent, \nrich, still youthful era of the German spirit, to which the mahcious fairy, \nromanticism, piped and sang, in those days when one was not yet able to distinguish \nbetween ‘finding’ and ‘inventing’! They found above all a faculty for the \n‘suprasensible’: Schelhng baptized it intellectual intuition, and therewith satisfied \nmost heartfelt longings of his Germans, which longings were fundamentally pious. \nOne can do no greater wrong to this whole high-spirited and enthusiastic \nmovement, which was really youthfulness however boldly it disguised itself in hoary \nand senile concepts, than to take it seriously and, an even worse injustice, to treat i\nwith moral indignation; it is enough to say that one grew older — and the dream \ndisappeared. A time came when one rubbed one's eyes: one is still rubbing them \ntoday. One had been dreaming: and the first and foremost of the dreamers was — old \nKant. ‘By means of a faculty’ — he had said, or at least meant. But is that — an \nanswer? An explanation? Or is it not rather merely a repetition of the question? \nHow does opium induce sleep? ‘By means of a faculty’, namely the virtus dormitiva \n— rephes the doctor in Mohère, \nquia est in eo virtus dormitiva, \n\n\ncujus est natura sensus assoupire. \nBut answers hke that belong in comedy, and it is high time to replace the Kantian \nquestion ‘how are synthetic judgements a priori possible?’ with another question: \n‘why is behef in such judgements necessary? — that is to say, it is time to grasp that\nfor the purpose of preserving beings such as ourselves, such judgements must be \nbeheved to be true; although they might of course still be false judgements! Or \nmore clearly, crudely and basically: synthetic judgements a priori should not “be \npossible’ at all: we have no right to them, in our mouths they are nothing but false \njudgements. But behef in their truth is, of course, necessary as foreground behef \nand ocular evidence belonging to the perspective optics of hfe. — Finally, in \nconsidering the enormous influence ‘German philosophy’ — I hope you understand \nits right to inverted commas? — has exercised throughout Europe, one cannot doubt \nthat a certainvirtus dormitiva has played a part in it: the noble idlers, the virtuous,\nthe mystics, the artists, the three-quarter Christians and the pohtical obscurantists \nof all nations were dehghted to possess, thanks to German philosophy, an antidote \nto the still overwhelming sensuahsm which had overflowed out of the previous \ncentury into this, in short — ‘sensus assoupire’..."

Let \nus therefore be more cautious for once, let us be ‘unphilosophical’ — let us say: in al\nwilhng there is, first of all, a plurahty of sensations, namely the sensation of the \ncondition we leave, the sensation of the condition towards which we go, the \nsensation of this ‘leaving’ and ‘going’ itself, and then also an accompanying \nmuscular sensation which, even without our putting ‘arms and legs’ in motion, \ncomes into play through a kind of habit as soon as we ‘will’. As feehngs, and indeed \nmany varieties of feehng, can therefore be recognized as an ingredient of will, so, in\nthe second place, can thinking: in every act of will there is a commanding thought — \nand do not imagine that this thought can be separated from the ‘wilhng’, as though \nwill would then remain over! Thirdly, will is not only a complex of feehng and \n\n\nthinking, but above all an affect: and in fact the affect of command. What is called \n‘freedom of will’ is essentially the affect of superiority over him who must obey: ʻI \nam free, “he” must obey’ — this consciousness adheres to every will, as does that \ntense attention, that straight look which fixes itself exclusively on one thing, that \nunconditional evaluation ‘this and nothing else is necessary now’, that inner \ncertainty that one will be obeyed, and whatever else pertains to the state of him who \ngives commands. A man who wills — commands something in himself which obeys \nor which he beheves obeys. But now observe the strangest thing of all about the will \n— about this so complex thing for which people have only one word: inasmuch as in \nthe given circumstances we at the same time command and obey, and as the side \nwhich obeys know the sensations of constraint, compulsion, pressure, resistance, \nmotion which usually begin immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the \nother hand, we are in the habit of disregarding and deceiving ourselves over this \nduahty by means of the synthetic concept ‘T; so a whole chain of erroneous \nconclusions and consequently of false evaluations of the will itself has become \nattached to the will as such — so that he who wills beheves wholeheartedly that \nwilhng suffices for action. Because in the great majority of cases wilhng takes place\nonly where the effect of the command, that is to say obedience, that is to say the \naction, was to be expected, the appearance has translated itself into the sensation, as\nif there were here a necessity of effect. Enough: he who wills beheves with a \ntolerable degree of certainty that will and action are somehow one — he attributes \nthe success, the carrying out of the wilhng, to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an\nincrease of that sensation of power which all success brings with it. ‘Freedom of \nwill’ — is the expression for that complex condition of pleasure of the person who \nwills, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of \nthe command — who as such also enjoys the triumph over resistances involved but \nwho thinks it was his will itself which overcame these resistances. He who wills \nadds in this way the sensations of pleasure of the successful executive agents, the \nserviceable ‘under-wills’ or under-souls — for our body is only a social structure \ncomposed of many souls — to his sensations of pleasure as commander. L'effet, c'est \nmoi: what happens here is what happens in every well-constructed and happy \ncommonwealth: the ruhng class identifies itself with the successes of the \ncommonwealth. In all wilhng it is absolutely a question of commanding and \nobeying, on the basis, as I have said already, of a social structure composed of \nmany ‘souls’: on which account a philosopher should claim the right to include \nwilhng as such within the field of morahty: that is, of morahty understood as the \ntheory of the relations of dominance under which the phenomenon ‘hfe’ arises. —"

Under an invisible spell they always trace once \nmore the identical orbit: however independent of one another they may feel, with \ntheir will to criticism or systematism, something in them leads them, something \ndrives them in a definite order one after another: it is precisely that innate \nsystematism and relationship of concepts. Their thinking is in fact not so much a \ndiscovering as a recognizing, a remembering, a retum and home-coming to a faroff, primordial total household of the soul out of which those concepts once \nemerged — philosophizing is to that extent a species of atavism of the first rank. The \nsingular family resemblance between all Indian, Greek and German philosophizing \nis easy enough to explain. Where there exists a language affinity it is quite \nimpossible, thanks to the common philosophy of grammar — I mean thanks to \nunconscious domination and directing by similar grammatical functions — to avoid \neverything being prepared in advance for a similar evolution and succession of \nphilosophical systems: just as the road seems to be barred to certain other \npossibihties of world interpretation. Philosophers within the domain of the UralAltaic languages (in which the concept of the subject is least developed) will in all \nprobabihty look ‘into the world’ differently and be found on different paths from the \nIndo-Germans and Moslems: the spell of definite grammatical functions is in the \nlast resort the spell of physiological value judgements and racial conditions. — So \nmuch by way of retort to Locke's superficiahty with regard to the origin of ideas."

For the desire for \n‘freedom of will’ in that metaphysical superlative sense which is unfortunately still \ndominant in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the whole and sole \nresponsibihty for one's actions and to absolve God, world, ancestors, chance, society \nfrom responsibihty for them, is nothing less than the desire to be precisely that \ncausa sui and, with more than Miinchhausen temerity, to pull oneself into existence \nout of the swamp of nothingness by one's own hair. Assuming it is possible in this \nway to get beyond the peasant simphcity of this celebrated concept ‘free will’ and \nbanish it from one's mind, I would then ask whoever does that to carry his \n‘enhghtenment’ a step further and also banish from his mind the contrary of that \nunnatural concept ‘free will’: I mean ‘unfree will’, which amounts to an abuse of \ncause and effect. One ought not to make ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ into material things, as \nnatural scientists do (and those who, hke them, naturahze in their thinking — ), in \naccordance with the prevaihng mechanistic stupidity which has the cause press and \npush until it ‘produces an effect’; one ought to employ ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ only as \npure concepts, that is to say as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation, \nmutual understanding, not explanation. In the ‘in itself’ there is nothing of ‘causal \nconnection’, of ‘necessity’, of ‘psychological unfreedom’; there ‘the effect’ does not \n‘follow the cause’, there no ‘law’ rules. It is we alone who have fabricated causes, \nsuccession, reciprocity, relativity, compulsion, number, law, freedom, motive, \npurpose; and when we falsely introduce this world of symbols into things and \nmingle it with them as though this symbol-world were an ‘in itself’, we once more \nbehave as we have always behaved, namely mythologically. ‘Unfree will’ is \n\n\nmythology: in real hfe it is only a question of strong and weak wills. — It is almost \nalways a symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker detects in every \n‘causal connection’ and ‘psychological necessity’ something of compulsion, \nexigency, constraint, pressure, unfreedom: such feehngs are traitors, the person who \nhas them gives himself away. And, if I have observed correctly, ‘unfreedom of will’ \nis in general conceived as a problem from two completely antithetical standpoints \nbut always in a profoundly personal manner: one will at no price give up his \n‘responsibihty’, his behef in himself, the personal right to his deserts (the vain ra\nbelong here — ), the other, on the contrary, will not be responsible for anything, to \nblame for anything, and out of an inner self-contempt wants to be able to shift off \nhis responsibihty for himself somewhere else. This latter, when he writes books, \ntends today to espouse the cause of the criminal; his most pleasing disguise is a kind \nof sociahst sympathy. And the fatahsm of the weak-willed is indeed beautified to an \nastonishing degree when it can present itself as ‘la rehgion de la souffrance \nhumaine’: that is its ‘good taste’."

He who, when trafficking with men, does not \noccasionally ghsten with all the shades of distress, green and grey with disgust, \nsatiety, sympathy, gloom and lonehness, is certainly not a man of an elevated taste; \nbut if he does not voluntarily assume this burden and displeasure, if he continually \navoids it and, as aforesaid, remains hidden quietly and proudly away in his citadel, \nthen one thing is sure: he is not made, not predestined for knowledge.

The study of the average human being, protracted, \nserious, and with much dissembhng, self-overcoming, intimacy, bad company — all \ncompany is bad company except the company of one's equals — : this constitutes a \nnecessary part of the hfe story of every philosopher, perhaps the most unpleasant \nand malodorous part and the part most full of disappointments.

The intention as the whole origin and prehistory \nof an action: it is under the sway of this prejudice that one has morally praised, \nblamed, judged and philosophized on earth almost to the present day. — But ought \nwe not today to have arrived at the necessity of once again determining upon an \ninversion and shift of values, thanks to another self-examination and deepening on \nthe part of man — ought we not to stand on the threshold of a period which should \nbe called, negatively at first, the extra-moral: today, when among us immorahsts at \nleast the suspicion has arisen that the decisive value of an action resides in precisel\nthat which is not intentional in it, and that all that in it which is intentional, all \nthat can be seen, known, ‘conscious’, still belongs to its surface and skin — which, \nhke every skin, betrays something but conceals still more? In brief, we beheve that \nthe intention is only a sign and symptom that needs interpreting, and a sign, \nmoreover, that signifies too many things and which thus taken by itself signifies \npractically nothing — that morahty in the sense in which it has been understood \nhitherto, that is to say the morahty of intentions, has been a prejudice, a precipitancy, perhaps something provisional and precursory, perhaps something of the \norder of astronomy and alchemy, but in any event something that must be \novercome. The overcoming of morahty, in a certain sense even the self-overcoming \nof morahty: let this be the name for that protracted secret labour which has been \nreserved for the subtlest, most honest and also most mahcious consciences as hving \ntouchstones of the soul. -"

Why not? It is no more than a \nmoral prejudice that truth is worth more than appearance; it is even the worstproved assumption that exists. Let us concede at least this much: there would be no \nhfe at all if not on the basis of perspective evaluations and appearances; and if, wit\nthe virtuous enthusiasm and awkwardness exhibited by some philosophers, one \nwanted to abohsh the ‘apparent world’ altogether, well, assuming you could do that \n— at any rate nothing would remain of your ‘truth’ either! Indeed, what compels us \nto assume there exists any essential antithesis between ‘true’ and ‘false’? Is it not \nenough to suppose grades of apparentness and as it were hghter and darker shades \nand tones of appearance — different valeurs, to speak in the language of painters? \nWhy could the world which is of any concem to us — not be a fiction? And he who \nthen objects: ‘but to the fiction there belongs an author?’ — could he not be met with \nthe round retort: why? Does this ‘belongs’ perhaps not also belong to the fiction? \nAre we not permitted to be a httle ironical now about the subject as we are about \nthe predicate and object?

C'est quand il est bon qu'il\nque la vertu corresponde a une ordre étemelle, c'est quand il contemple les choses \nd'une manière désintéressée qu'il trouve la mort révoltante et absurde. Comment ne \npas supposer que c'est dans ces moments-la, que l'homme voit le mieux ?...’ These \nwords are so totally antipodal to my ears and habits that when I discovered them my \nimmediate anger wrote beside them ‘la niaiserie rehgieuse par excellence! — until \nmy subsequent anger actually began to hke them, these words with their upsidedown-truth! It is so pleasant, so distinguishing, to possess one's own antipodes!"

For in the past one beheved in ‘the \nsoul’ as one beheved in grammar and the grammatical subject: one said ‘T is the \ncondition, ‘think’ is the predicate and conditioned — thinking is an activity to which \na subject must be thought of as cause.

And that consequently \nmodem, noisy, time-consuming, proud and stupidly proud industriousness educates \nand prepares precisely for ‘unbehef’ more than anything else does? Among those in \nGermany for example who nowadays hve without rehgion, I find people whose \n‘free-thinking’ is of differing kinds and origins but above all a majority of those in \nwhom industriousness from generation to generation has extinguished the rehgious \ninstincts: so that they no longer have any idea what rehgions are supposed to be for \nand as it were merely register their existence in the world with a kind of dumb \namazement. They feel they are already fully occupied, these worthy people, whether \nwith their businesses or with their pleasures, not to speak of the ‘fatherland’ and the\nnewspapers and ‘family duties’: it seems that they have no time at all left for \nrehgion, especially as it is not clear to them whether it involves another business or\nanother pleasure — for they tell themselves it is not possible that one goes to church \nsimply to make oneself miserable. They are not opposed to rehgious usages; if \nparticipation in such usages is demanded in certain cases, by the state for instance, \nthey do what is demanded of them as one does so many things — with patient and \nmodest seriousness and without much curiosity and discomfort — it is only that they \nhve too much aside and outside even to feel the need for any for or against in such \nthings. The great majority of German middle-class Protestants can today be \nnumbered among these indifferent people, especially in the great industrious centres \nof trade and commerce; hkewise the great majority of industrious scholars and the \nentire university equipage (excepting the theologians, whose possibihty and \npresence there provides the psychologist with ever more and ever subtler enigmas to \nsolve). Pious or even merely church-going people seldom reahze how much good \nwill, one might even say willfulness, it requires nowadays for a German scholar to \ntake the problem of rehgion seriously; his whole trade (and, as said above, the \ntradesmanhke industriousness to which his modem conscience obhges him) \ndisposes him to a superior, almost good-natured merriment in regard to rehgion, \nsometimes mixed with a mild contempt directed at the ‘uncleanhness’ of spirit \nwhich he presupposes wherever one still belongs to the church. It is only with the \naid of history (thus not from his personal experience) that the scholar succeeds in \nsummoning up a reverent seriousness and a certain shy respect towards rehgion; but \nif he intensifies his feehngs towards it even to the point of feehng grateful to it, \nhas still in his own person not got so much as a single step closer to that which still\nexists as church or piety: perhaps the reverse. The practical indifference to rehgious\nthings in which he was bom and raised is as a rule subhmated in him into a caution \n\n\nand cleanhness which avoids contact with rehgious people and things; and it can be \nprecisely the depth of his tolerance and humanity that bids him evade the subtle \ndistress which tolerance itself brings with it. — Every age has its own divine kind of \nnaivety for the invention of which other ages may envy it — and how much naivety, \nvenerable, childhke and boundlessly stupid naivety there is in the scholar's behef in\nhis superiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance, in the simple unsuspecting \ncertainty with which his instinct treats the rehgious man as an inferior and lower \ntype which he himself has grown beyond and above — he, the httle presumptuous \ndwarf and man of the mob, the brisk and busy head- and handyman of ‘ideas’, of \n‘modem ideas’!"

The influence on selection and breeding, that is to say the destructive as \nwell as the creative and formative influence which can be exercised with the aid of \nthe rehgions, is manifold and various depending on the kind of men placed under \ntheir spell and protection. For the strong and independent prepared and predestined \nfor command, in whom the art and reason of a ruhng race is incamated, rehgion is \none more means of overcoming resistance so as to be able to rule: as a bond that \nunites together ruler and ruled and betrays and hands over to the former the \nconsciences of the latter, all that is hidden and most intimate in them which would \nhke to exclude itself from obedience; and if some natures of such noble descent \ninchne through lofty spirituahty to a more withdrawn and meditative hfe and \nreserve to themselves only the most refined kind of rule (over select disciples or \nbrothers), then rehgion can even be used as a means of obtaining peace from the \nnoise and effort of cruder modes of govemment, and cleanhness from the necessary \ndirt of all pohtics. Thus did the Brahmins, for example, arrange things: with the aid \nof a rehgious organization they gave themselves the power of nominating their kings \nfor the people, while keeping and feehng themselves aside and outside as men of \nhigher and more than kingly tasks. In the meantime, rehgion also gives a section of \nthe ruled guidance and opportunity for preparing itself for future rule and \ncommand; that is to say, those slowly rising orders and classes in which through \nfortunate marriage customs the strength and joy of the will, the will to self-mastery \nis always increasing — rehgion presents them with sufficient instigations and \ntemptations to take the road to higher spirituahty, to test the feehngs of great self\novercoming, of silence and sohtude — asceticism and puritanism are virtually \nindispensable means of education and ennobhng if a race wants to become master \nover its origins in the rabble, and work its way up towards future rule. To ordinary \nmen, finally, the great majority, who exist for service and general utihty and who \nmay exist only for that purpose, rehgion gives an invaluable contentment with their \nnature and station, manifold peace of heart, an ennobhng of obedience, one piece \nof joy and sorrow more to share with their fellows, and some transfiguration of the \nwhole everydayness, the whole lowhness, the whole half-bestial poverty of their \nsouls. Rehgion and the rehgious significance of hfe sheds sunshine over these \nperpetual drudges and makes their own sight tolerable to them, it has the effect \nwhich an Epicurean philosophy usually has on sufferers of a higher rank, refreshing, \nrefining, as it were making the most use of suffering, ultimately even sanctifying and \njustifying. Perhaps nothing in Christianity and Buddhism is so venerable as their art \nof teaching even the lowhest to set themselves through piety in an apparently higher \norder of things and thus to preserve their contentment with the real order, within \n\n\nwhich they hve hard enough hves — and necessarily have to!"

Among men, as among every \nother species, there is a surplus of failures, of the sick, the degenerate, the fragile\nof those who are bound to suffer; the successful cases are, among men too, always \nthe exception, and, considering that man is the animal whose nature has not yet been \nfixed, the rare exception. But worse still: the higher the type of man a man \nrepresents, the greater the improbabihty he will tum out well: chance, the law of \nabsurdity in the total economy of mankind, shows itself in its most dreadful shape \nin its destructive effect on higher men, whose conditions of hfe are subtle, manifold \nand difficult to compute.

However highly one may rate this kindly \npreservative sohcitude, inasmuch as, together with all the other types of man, it has \nbeen and is apphed to the highest type, which has hitherto almost always been the \ntype that has suffered most: in the total accounting the hitherto sovereign rehgions \nare among the main reasons the type ‘man’ has been kept on a lower level — they \nhave preserved too much of that which ought to perish. We have inestimable \nbenefits to thank them for; and who is sufficiently rich in gratitude not to be \nimpoverished in face of all that the ‘spiritual men’ of Christianity, for example, have\nhitherto done for Europe! And yet, when they gave comfort to the suffering, \ncourage to the oppressed and despairing, a staff and stay to the irresolute, and lured \nthose who were inwardly shattered and had become savage away from society into \nmonasteries and houses of correction for the soul: what did they have to do in \naddition so as thus, with a good conscience, as a matter of principle, to work at the \npreservation of everything sick and suffering, which means in fact and truth at the \ncorruption of the European race? Stand all evaluations on their head — that is what \nthey had to do! And smash the strong, contaminate great hopes, cast suspicion on \njoy in beauty, break down everything autocratic, manly, conquering, tyrannical, all \nthe instincts proper to the highest and most successful of the type ‘man’, into \nuncertainty, remorse of conscience, self-destruction, indeed reverse the whole love \nof the earthly and of dominion over the earth into hatred of the earth and the \nearthly — that is the task the church set itself and had to set itself, until in its \nevaluation ‘unworldhness’, ‘unsensuahty’, and ‘higher man’ were finally fused \ntogether into one feehng. Supposing one were able to view the strangely painful and \nat the same time coarse and subtle comedy of European Christianity with the \nmocking and unconcemed eye of an Epicurean god, I beheve there would be no end \n\n\nto one's laughter and amazement: for does it not seem that one will has dominated \nEurope for eighteen centuries, the will to make of man a subhme abortion?

Was this a work for your hands! How you have bungled and \nbotched my beautiful stone! What a thing for you to take upon yourselves!’ — What \nI am saying is: Christianity has been the most fatal kind of self-presumption ever. \nMen not high or hard enough for the artistic refashioning of mankind; men not \nstrong or farsighted enough for the subhme self-constraint needed to allow the \nforeground law of thousandfold failure and perishing to prevail; men not noble \nenough to see the abysmal disparity in order of rank and abysm of rank between \nmen and man — it is such men who, with their ‘equal before God’, have hitherto \nruled over the destiny of Europe, until at last a shrunken, almost ludicrous species, a\nherd animal, something full of good will, sickly and mediocre has been bred, the \nEuropean of today... \nPart Four: Maxims and Interludes"

      "text": "Moral sensibihty is as subtle, late, manifold, sensitive and refined in Europe today \nas the ‘science of morals’ pertaining to it is still young, inept, clumsy and coarsefingered — an interesting contrast which sometimes even becomes visible and \nincamate in the person of a morahst. Even the expression ‘science of morals’ is, \nconsidering what is designated by it, far too proud, and contrary to good taste: \nwhich is always accustomed to choose the more modest expressions. One should, in \nall strictness, admit what will be needful here for a long time to come, what alone is \nprovisionally justified here: assembly of material, conceptual comprehension and \narrangement of a vast domain of dehcate value-feehngs and value-distinctions \nwhich hve, grow, beget and perish — and perhaps attempts to display the more \nfrequent and recurring forms of these hving crystalhzations — as preparation of a \ntypology of morals. To be sure: one has not been so modest hitherto. Philosophers \none and all have, with a strait-laced seriousness that provokes laughter, demanded \nsomething much higher, more pretentious, more solemn of themselves as soon as \nthey have concemed themselves with morahty as a science: they wanted to fumish \n\n\nthe rational ground of morahty — and every philosopher hitherto has beheved he has \nfumished this rational ground; morahty itself, however, was taken as ‘given’. How \nfar from their clumsy pride was that apparently insignificant task left in dust and \nmildew, the task of description, although the most dehcate hands and senses could \nhardly be dehcate enough for it! It was precisely because moral philosophers knew \nthe facts of morahty only somewhat vaguely in an arbitrary extract or as a chance \nabridgement, as morahty of their environment, their class, their church, the spirit of\ntheir times, their chmate and zone of the earth, for instance — it was precisely \nbecause they were ill informed and not even very inquisitive about other peoples, \nages and former times, that they did not so much as catch sight of the real problems \nof morahty — for these come into view only if we compare many morahties. Strange \nthough it may sound, in all ‘science of morals’ hitherto the problem of morahty \nitself has been lacking: the suspicion was lacking that there was anything \nproblematic here. What philosophers called ‘the rational ground of morahty’ and \nsought to fumish was, viewed in the proper hght, only a scholarly form of faith in \nthe prevaihng morahty, a new way of expressing it, and thus itself a fact within a \ncertain morahty, indeed even in the last resort a kind of denial that this morahty \nought to be conceived of as a problem — and in any event the opposite of a testing, \nanalysis, doubting and vivisection of this faith. Hear, for example, with what almost \nvenerable innocence Schopenhauer still presented his task, and draw your own \nconclusions as to how scientific a ‘science’ is whose greatest masters still talk hke \nchildren and old women: — “The principle’, he says (Fundamental Problems of \nEthics), \nthe fundamental proposition on whose content all philosophers of ethics are actually at\nneminem laede, immo omnes, quantum potes, juva — is actually the proposition of which a\nthe teachers of morals endeavour to fumish the rational ground... the actual foundatio\nethics which has been sought for centuries hke the philosopher's stone. \n— The difficulty of fumishing the rational ground for the above-quoted proposition \nmay indeed be great — as is well known, Schopenhauer too failed to do it — ; and he \nwho has ever been certain how insipidly false and sentimental this proposition is in \na world whose essence is will to power — may hke to recall that Schopenhauer, \nalthough a pessimist, actually — played the flute... Every day, after dinner: read his \nbiographers on this subject. And by the way: a pessimist, a world-denier and Goddenier, who comes to a halt before morahty — who affirms morahty and plays the \nflute, affirms laede neminem morahty: what? is that actually — a pessimist?"

The essential and invaluable element in every morahty is \nthat it is a protracted constraint: to understand Stoicism or Port-Royal or Puritanism \none should recall the constraint under which every language has hitherto attained \nstrength and freedom — the metrical constraint, the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm. \nHow much trouble the poets and orators of every nation have given themselves! — \nnot excluding a few present-day prose writers in whose ear there dwells an \ninexorable conscience — ‘for the sake of foohshness’, as the utihtarian fools say, \nthinking they are clever — ‘from subjection to arbitrary laws’, as the anarchists say, \nfeehng themselves ‘free’, even free-spirited. But the strange fact is that all there i\nhas been on earth of freedom, subtlety, boldness, dance and masterly certainty, \nwhether in thinking itself, or in ruhng, or in speaking and persuasion, in the arts as\nin morals, has evolved only by virtue of the ‘tyranny of such arbitrary laws’; and, in \nall seriousness, there is no small probabihty that precisely this is ‘nature’ and \n‘natural’ — and not that laisser aller! Every artist knows how far from the feehng of \nletting himself go his ‘natural’ condition is, the free ordering, placing, disposing, \nforming in the moment of ‘inspiration’ — and how strictly and subtly he then obeys \nthousandfold laws which precisely on account of their severity and definiteness \nmock all formulation in concepts (even the firmest concept is by comparison \nsomething fluctuating, manifold, ambiguous —). The essential thing ‘in heaven and \nupon earth’ seems, to say it again, to be a protracted obedience in one direction: \nfrom out of that there always emerges and has always emerged in the long run \nsomething for the sake of which it is worthwhile to hve on earth, for example \nvirtue, art, music, dance, reason, spirituahty — something transfiguring, refined, mad\nand divine. Protracted unfreedom of spirit, mistrustful constraint in the \ncommunicabihty of ideas, the disciphne thinkers imposed on themselves to think \nwithin an ecclesiastical or courtly rule or under Aristotehan presuppositions, the \nprotracted spiritual will to interpret all events according to a Christian scheme and \nto rediscover and justify the Christian God in every chance occurrence — all these \nviolent, arbitrary, severe, gruesome and antirational things have shown themselves \nto be the means by which the European spirit was disciphned in its strength, \n\n\nruthless curiosity and subtle flexibihty: though admittedly an irreplaceable quantity \nof force and spirit had at the same time to be suppressed, stifled and spoiled (for \nhere as everywhere ‘nature’ shows itself as it is, in all its prodigal and indifferent \nmagnificence, which is noble though it outrage our feehngs). That for thousands of \nyears European thinkers thought only so as to prove something — today, on the \ncontrary, we suspect any thinker who ‘wants to prove something’ — that they always \nknew in advance that which was supposed to result from the most rigorous \ncogitation, as used to be the case with Asiatic astrology and is still the case with th\ninnocuous Christian-moral interpretation of the most intimate personal experiences \n‘to the glory of God’ and ‘for the salvation of the soul’ — this tyranny, this \narbitrariness, this rigorous and grandiose stupidity has educated the spirit; it seems \nthat slavery, in the cruder and in the more refined sense, is the indispensable means \nalso for spiritual disciphne and breeding. Regard any morahty from this point of \nview: it is ‘nature’ in it which teaches hatred of laisser aller, of too great freedom,\nand which implants the need for hmited horizons and immediate tasks — which \nteaches the narrowing of perspective, and thus in a certain sense stupidity, as a \ncondition of hfe and growth. “Thou shalt obey someone and for a long time: \notherwise thou shalt perish and lose all respect for thyself’ — this seems to me to be \nnature's imperative, which is, to be sure, neither ‘categorical’ as old Kant demanded \nit should be (hence the ‘otherwise’ —), nor addressed to the individual (what do \nindividuals matter to nature!), but to peoples, races, ages, classes, and above all to \nthe entire animal ‘man’, to mankind."

For the bad man does injury to himself: this he \nwould not do if he knew that badness is bad. Thus the bad man is bad only in \nconsequence of an error; if one cures him of his error, one necessarily makes him — \ngood.’ — This way of reasoning smells of the mob, which sees in bad behaviour only \nits disagreeable consequences and actually judges ‘it is stupid to act badly’; while it\ntakes ‘good’ without further ado to be identical with ‘useful and pleasant’. In the \ncase of every utihtarian morahty one may conjecture in advance a similar origin and \nfollow one's nose: one will seldom go astray. — Plato did all he could to interpret \nsomething refined and noble into his teacher's proposition, above all himself — he, \nthe most intrepid of interpreters, who picked up the whole of Socrates only in the \nmanner of a popular tune from the streets, so as to subject it to infinite and \nimpossible variations: that is, to make it into all his own masks and multiphcities. \nOne might ask in jest, and in Homeric jest at that: what is the Platonic Socrates if \nnot prosthe Platon opithen te Platon messé te chimaira?"

Socrates himself, to be sure, had, with the taste appropriate to his \ntalent — that of a superior dialectician — initially taken the side of reason; and what\nindeed did he do all his hfe long but laugh at the clumsy incapacity of his noble \nAthenians, who were men of instinct, hke all noble men, and were never able to \nsupply adequate information about the reasons for their actions? Ultimately, \nhowever, in silence and secrecy, he laughed at himself too: he found in himself, \nbefore his more refined conscience and self-interrogation, the same difficulty and \nincapacity. But why, he exhorted himself, should one therefore abandon the \ninstincts! One must help both them and reason to receive their due — one must \nfollow the instincts, but persuade reason to aid them with good arguments. This was \nthe actual falsity of that great ironist, who had so many secrets; he induced his \nconscience to acquiesce in a sort of self-outwitting: fundamentally he had seen \nthrough the irrational aspect of moral judgement. — Plato, more innocent in such \nthings and without the craftiness of the plebeian, wanted at the expenditure of all \nhis strength — the greatest strength any philosopher has hitherto had to expend! — to \nprove to himself that reason and instinct move of themselves towards one goal, \ntowards the good, towards ‘God’; and since Plato all theologians and philosophers \nhave followed the same path — that is to say, in moral matters instinct, or as the \nChristians call it ‘faith’, or as I call it ‘the herd’, has hitherto triumphed.

In regard to a woman, for example, the \nmore modest man counts the simple disposal of her body and sexual gratification as \na sufficient and satisfactory sign of having, of possession; another, with a more \njealous and demanding thirst for possession, sees the ‘question-mark’, the merely \napparent quahty of such a having and requires subtler tests, above all in order to \nknow whether the woman not only gives herself to him but also gives up for his \nsake what she has or would hke to have — : only thus does she count to him as \n‘possessed’. A third, however, is not done with jealousy and desire for having even \nthen; he asks himself whether, when the woman gives up everything for him, she \ndoes not perhaps do so for a phantom of him: he demands that she know him to the \nvery heart before she is able to love him at all, he dares to let himself be unravelled\n— .

Thi\nneed seeks to be satisfied and to fill out its form with a content; in doing so it gras\nabout wildly, according to the degree of its strength, impatience and tension, with \nhttle discrimination, as a crude appetite, and accepts whatever any commander — \nparent, teacher, law, class prejudice, pubhc opinion — shouts in its ears.

Supposing that even there a constant httle \nexercise of consideration, pity, faimess, mildness, mutual aid was practised, \nsupposing that even at that stage of society all those drives are active which are late\nhonourably designated ‘virtues’ and are finally practically equated with the concept \n‘morahty’: in that era they do not yet by any means belong to the domain of moral \nvaluations — they are still extra-moral. An act of pity, for example, was during the \nfinest age of Rome considered neither good nor bad, neither moral nor immoral; \nand even if it was commended, this commendation was entirely compatible with a \nkind of involuntary disdain, as soon, that is, as it was set beside any action which \nserved the welfare of the whole, of the res pubhca. Ultimately ‘love of one's \nneighbour’ is always something secondary, in part conventional and arbitrarily \nillusory, when compared with fear of one's neighbour. Once the structure of society \nseems to have been in general fixed and made safe from extemal dangers, it is this \nfear of one's neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral valuation. \nThere are certain strong and dangerous drives, such as enterprisingness, \nfoolhardiness, revengefulness, craft, rapacity, ambition, which hitherto had not only \nto be honoured from the point of view of their social utihty — under different \nnames, naturally, from those chosen here — but also mightily developed and \ncultivated (because they were constantly needed to protect the community as a \nwhole against the enemies of the community as a whole); these drives are now felt \nto be doubly dangerous — now that the diversionary outlets for them are lacking — \nand are gradually branded as immoral and given over to calumny. The antithetical \ndrives and inchnations now come into moral honour; step by step the herd instinct \ndraws its conclusions. How much or how httle that is dangerous to the community, \ndangerous to equahty, resides in an opinion, in a condition or emotion, in a will, ina\ntalent, that is now the moral perspective: here again fear is the mother of morahty. \nWhen the highest and strongest drives, breaking passionately out, carry the \nindividual far above and beyond the average and lowlands of the herd conscience, \nthe self-confidence of the community goes to pieces, its faith in itself, its spine as \nwere, is broken: consequently it is precisely these drives which are most branded \nand calumniated. Lofty spiritual independence, the will to stand alone, great \nintelhgence even, are felt to be dangerous; everything that raises the individual \nabove the herd and makes his neighbour quail is henceforth called evil; the fair, \nmodest, obedient, self-effacing disposition, the mean and average in desires, \nacquires moral names and honours. Eventually, under very peaceful conditions, \nthere is less and less occasion or need to educate one's feehngs in severity and \n\n\nstemness; and now every kind of severity, even severity in justice, begins to trouble \nthe conscience; a stem and lofty nobihty and self-responsibihty is received almost \nas an offence and awakens mistrust, ‘the lamb’, even more ‘the sheep’, is held in \nhigher and higher respect. There comes a point of morbid mellowing and overtendemess in the history of society at which it takes the side even of him who \nharms it, the criminal, and does so honestly and wholeheartedly. Punishment: that \nseems to it somehow unfair — certainly the idea of ‘being punished’ and ‘having to \npunish’ is unpleasant to it, makes it afraid. ‘Is it not enough to render him harmless?\nwhy punish him as well? To administer punishment is itself dreadful!’ — with this \nquestion herd morahty, the morahty of timidity, draws its ultimate conclusion. \nSupposing all danger, the cause of fear, could be abohshed, this morahty would \ntherewith also be abohshed: it would no longer be necessary, it would no longer \nregard itself as necessary! — He who examines the conscience of the present-day \nEuropean will have to extract from a thousand moral recesses and hiding-places \nalways the same imperative, the imperative of herd timidity: ‘we wish that there will \none day no longer be anything to fear! One day — everywhere in Europe the will \nand way to that day is now called ‘progress’."

But that the tempo of this movement is much too \n\n\nslow and somnolent for the more impatient, for the sick and suffering of the said \ninstinct, is attested by the ever more frantic baying, the ever more undisguised fangbaring of the anarchist dogs which now rove the streets of European culture: \napparently the reverse of the placidly industrious democrats and revolutionary \nideologists, and even more so of the stupid philosophasters and brotherhood fanatics \nwho call themselves sociahsts and want a ‘free society’, they are in fact at one with \nthem all in their total and instinctive hostihty towards every form of society other \nthan that of the autonomous herd (to the point of repudiating even the concepts \n‘master’ and ‘servant’ — ni dieu ni maitre says a sociahst formula — ); at one in thei\ntenacious opposition to every special claim, every special right and privilege (that is\nto say, in the last resort to every right: for when everyone is equal no one will need \nany ‘rights’ — ); at one in their mistrust of punitive justice (as if it were an assaul\nthe weaker, an injustice against the necessary consequence of all previous society — \n); but equally at one in the rehgion of pity, in sympathy with whatever feels, hves, \nsuffers (down as far as the animals, up as far as ‘God’ — the extravagance of ‘pity for\nGod belongs in a democratic era — ); at one, one and all, in the cry and impatience \nof pity, in mortal hatred for suffering in general, in their almost feminine incapacity\nto remain spectators of suffering, to let suffer; at one in their involuntary gloom and\nsensitivity, under whose spell Europe seems threatened with a new Buddhism; at \none in their faith in the morahty of mutual pity, as if it were morahty in itself and\nthe pinnacle, the attained pinnacle of man, the sole hope of the future, the \nconsolation of the present and the great redemption from all the guilt of the past — \nat one, one and all, in their faith in the community as the saviour, that is to say in \nthe herd, in ‘themselves’..."

In my view it is only from one's \nexperience — experience always means bad experience, does it not? — that one can \nacquire the right to speak on such a higher question of rank: otherwise one will talk \nhke a bhnd man about colours or hke women and artists against science (‘oh this \nwicked science’, their modesty and instinct sighs, ‘it always exposes the facts!’—-). \nThe Declaration of Independence of the man of science, his emancipation from \nphilosophy, is one of the more subtle after-effects of the democratic form and \nformlessness of hfe: the self-glorification and presumption of the scholar now \n\n\nstands everywhere in full bloom and in its finest springtime — which does not mean \nto say that in this case self-praise smells sweetly. “Away with all masters!’ — that is\nwhat the plebeian instinct desires here too; and now that science has most \nsuccessfully resisted theology, whose ‘hand-maid’ it was for too long, it is now, with \ngreat high spirits and a plentiful lack of understanding, taking it upon itself to lay \ndown laws for philosophy and for once to play the ‘master’ — what am I saying? to \nplay the philosopher itself. My memory — the memory of a man of science, if I may \nsay so! — is full of arrogant naiveties I have heard about philosophy and \nphilosophers from young scientists and old physicians (not to speak of the most \ncultured and conceited of all scholars, the philologists and schoolmen, who are both \nby profession —). Now it was the speciahst and jobbing workman who instinctively \nopposed synthetic undertakings and capacities in general; now the industrious \nlabourer who had got a scent of the otium and noble luxury in the philosopher's \nphysical economy and felt wronged and diminished by it. Now it was that colour \nbhndness of the utihty man who sees in philosophy nothing but a series of refuted \nsystems and a wasteful expenditure which ‘benefits’ nobody. Now a fear of disguised \nmysticism and a rectification of the frontiers of knowledge leaped out; now a \ndisrespect for an individual philosopher which had involuntarily generahzed itself \ninto a disrespect for philosophy. Finally, what I found most frequently among young \nscholars was that behind the arrogant disdain for philosophy there lay the evil aftereffect of a philosopher himself, from whom they had, to be sure, withdrawn their \nallegiance, without, however, having got free from the spell of his disparaging \nevaluation of other philosophers — the result being a feehng of ill humour towards \nphilosophy in general. (This is the sort of after-effect which, it seems to me, \nSchopenhauer, for example, has had on Germany in recent years — with his \nunintelhgent rage against Hegel he succeeded in disconnecting the entire last \ngeneration of Germans from German culture, which culture was, all things \nconsidered, a high point and divinatory refinement of the historical sense: but \nSchopenhauer himself was in precisely this respect poor, unreceptive and unGerman to the point of genius.) In general and broadly speaking, it may have been \nabove all the human, all too human element, in short the poverty of the most recent \nphilosophy itself, which has been most thoroughly prejudicial to respect for \nphilosophy and has opened the gates to the instinct of the plebeian. For one must \nadmit how completely the whole species of a Herachtus, a Plato, an Empedocles, \nand whatever else these royal and splendid hermits of the spirit were called, is \nlacking in our modem world; and to what degree, in face of such representatives of \nphilosophy as are, thanks to fashion, at present as completely on top as they are \ncompletely abysmal (in Germany, for example, the two hons of Berhn, the anarchist \nEugen Dühring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann) — a worthy man of \nscience is justified in feehng he is of a better species and descent. It is, in partic\nthe sight of those hotchpotch-philosophers who call themselves ‘philosophers of \nreahty’ or ‘positivists’ which is capable of implanting a perilous mistrust in the sou\nof an ambitious young scholar: these gentlemen are at best scholars and speciahsts \nthemselves, that fact is palpable! — they are one and all defeated men brought back \nunder the sway of science, who at some time or other demanded more of \nthemselves without having the right to this ‘more’ and the responsibihty that goes \nwith it — and who now honourably, wrathfully, revengefully represent by word and \ndeed the unbehef in the lordly task and lordhness of philosophy. Finally: how could \n\n\nthings be otherwise! Science is flourishing today and its good conscience shines in \nits face, while that to which the whole of modem philosophy has gradually sunk, \nthis remnant of philosophy, arouses distrust and displeasure when it does not arouse \nmockery and pity. Philosophy reduced to ‘theory of knowledge’, actually no more \nthan a timid epochism and abstinence doctrine: a philosophy that does not even get \nover the threshold and painfully denies itself the right of entry — that is philosophy \nat its last gasp, an end, an agony, something that arouses pity. How could such a \nphilosophy — rule!"

The compass and \ntower-building of the sciences has grown enormous, and therewith the probabihty \nhas also grown enormous that the philosopher will become weary while still no \nmore than a leamer, or that he will let himself be stopped somewhere and \n‘speciahze’: so that he will never reach his proper height, the height from which he \ncan survey, look around and look down. Or that he will reach this height too late, \nwhen his best time is past and his best strength spent; or damaged, coarsened, \ndegenerate, so that his view, his total value judgement, no longer means much. \nPerhaps it is the very refinement of his intellectual conscience which makes him \nhnger on the way and arrive late; he fears he may be seduced into dilettantism, into \nbecoming an insect with a thousand feet and a thousand antennae, he knows too \nwell that one who has lost respect for himself can no longer command, can no \nlonger lead as a man of knowledge either, unless he wants to become a great actor, \na philosophical Caghostro and pied piper of the spirit, in short a mis-leader. This is\nultimately a question of taste even if it were not a question of conscience. In \naddition to this, so as to redouble his difficulties, there is the fact that the \nphilosopher demands of himself a judgement, a Yes or No, not in regard to the \nsciences but in regard to hfe and the value of hfe — that he is reluctant to beheve \nhas a right, to say nothing of a duty, to come to such a judgement, and has to find \nhis way to this right and this faith only through the widest — perhaps most disturbing \nand shattering — experiences, and often hesitating, doubting, and being struck dumb. \nIndeed, the mob has long confounded and confused the philosopher with someone \nelse, whether with the man of science or with the rehgiously exalted, dead to the \nsenses, ‘dead to the world’ fanatic and drunkard of God; and today if one hears \nanyone commended for hving ‘wisely’ or ‘hke a philosopher’, it means hardly more \nthan ‘prudently and apart’. Wisdom: that seems to the rabble to be a kind of fhght, \nan artifice and means for getting oneself out of a dangerous game; but the genuine \nphilosopher — as he seems to us, my friends? — hves ‘unphilosophically’ and \n‘unwisely’, above all imprudently, and bears the burden and duty of a hundred \nattempts and temptations of hfe — he risks himself constantly, he plays the \ndangerous game..."

To both of \nthem, indeed, to the scholar and to the old maid, one concedes respectabihty, by \nway of compensation as it were — one emphasizes the respectabihty in these cases — \nand experiences the same feehng of annoyance at having been constrained to this \nconcession. Let us look more closely: what is the man of science? An ignoble \nspecies of man for a start, with the virtues of an ignoble, that is to say subservient,\nunauthoritative and un-self-sufficient species of man: he possesses industriousness, \npatient acknowledgement of his proper place in the rank and file, uniformity and \nmoderation in abihties and requirements, he possesses the instinct for his own kind \nand for that which his own kind have need of, for example that httle bit of \nindependence and green pasture without which there is no quiet work, that claim to \nhonour and recognition (which first and foremost presupposes recognizabihty —), \nthat sunshine of a good name, that constant affirmation of his value and his utihty \nwith which his inner distrust, the dregs at the heart of all dependent men and herd \nanimals, have again and again to be overcome. The scholar also possesses, as is only \nto be expected, the diseases and ill breeding of an ignoble species: he is full of pett\nenvy and has very keen eyes for what is base in those natures to whose heights he is \nunable to rise. He is trusting, but only hke one who sometimes lets himself go but \nnever lets himself flow out; and it is precisely in the presence of men who do flow \nout that he becomes the more frosty and reserved — his eye is then hke a reluctant \nsmooth lake whose surface is disturbed by no ripple of dehght or sympathy. The \nworst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable comes from the \ninstinct of mediocrity which characterizes his species: from that Jesuitism of \nmediocrity which instinctively works for the destruction of the uncommon man and \ntries to break or — better still! — relax every bent bow.

The objective man who no longer scolds or \ncurses as the pessimist does, the ideal scholar in whom the scientific instinct, after \nthousandfold total and partial failure, for once comes to full bloom, is certainly one \nof the most precious instruments there are: but he belongs in the hand of one who is \nmightier. He is only an instrument, let us say a mirror — he is not an ‘end in himself’\nAnd the objective man is in fact a mirror: accustomed to submitting to whatever \n\n\nwants to be known, lacking any other pleasure than that provided by knowledge, by \n‘mirroring’ — he waits until something comes along and then gently spreads himself \nout, so that not even the hghtest footsteps and the fluttering of ghostly beings shall\nbe lost on his surface and skin. Whatever still remains to him of his ‘own person’ \nseems to him accidental, often capricious, more often disturbing: so completely has \nhe become a passage and reflection of forms and events not his own. He finds it an \neffort to think about ‘himself’, and not infrequently he thinks about himself \nmistakenly; he can easily confuse himself with another, he fails to understand his \nown needs and is in this respect alone unsubtle and neghgent. Perhaps he is troubled \nby his health or by the pettiness and stuffiness of his wife and friends, or by a lack \nof companions and company — yes, he forces himself to reflect on his troubles: but \nin vain! Already his thoughts are roaming, off to a more general case, and tomorrow \nhe will know as httle how to help himself as he did yesterday. He no longer knows \nhow to take himself seriously, nor does he have the time for it: he is cheerful, not \nbecause he has no troubles but because he has no fingers and facihty for deahng \nwith his troubles. His habitual going out to welcome everything and every \nexperience, the sunny and ingenuous hospitahty with which he accepts all he \nencounters, his inconsiderate benevolence, his perilous unconcemedness over Yes \nand No: alas, how often he has to suffer for these his virtues! — and as a human \nbeing in general he can all too easily become the caput mortuum of these virtues. If \nlove and hatred are demanded of him, I mean love and hatred as God, woman and \nanimal understand them —: he will do what he can and give what he can. But one \nought not to be surprised if it is not very much — if he proves spurious, brittle, \nquestionable and soft. His love and his hatred are artificial and more of a tour de \nforce, a piece of vanity and exaggeration. For he is genuine only when he can be \nobjective: only in his cheerful totahsm can he remain ‘nature’ and ‘natural’. His \nmirroring soul, for ever pohshing itself, no longer knows how to affirm or how to \ndeny; he does not command, neither does he destroy. ‘Je ne méprise presque rien’ — \nhe says with Leibniz: one should not overlook or underestimate the presque! Nor is \nhe an exemplar; he neither leads nor follows; he sets himself altogether too far off to\nhave any reason to take sides between good and evil. When he was for so long \nconfused with the philosopher, with the Caesarian cultivator and Gewaltmensch of \nculture, he was done much too great honour and what is essential in him was \noverlooked — he is an instrument, something of a slave, if certainly the subhmest \nkind of slave, but in himself he is nothing — presque rien! The objective man is an \ninstrument, a precious, easily damaged and tamished measuring instrument and \nreflecting apparatus which ought to be respected and taken good care of; but he is \nnot an end, a termination and ascent, a complementary man in whom the rest of \nexistence is justified, a conclusion — and even less a beginning, a begetting and first\ncause, something sohd, powerful and based firmly on itself that wants to be master: \nbut rather only a dehcate, empty, elegant, flexible mould which has first to wait for \nsome content so as ‘to form’ itself by it — as a rule a man without content, a ‘selfles\nman. Consequently nothing for women either, in parenthesis. —"

      "text": "When a philosopher today gives us to understand that he is not a sceptic — I hope \nthe foregoing account of the objective spirit has brought this out? — all the world is \noffended to hear it; thereafter he is regarded with a certain dread, there is so much \none would hke to ask him... indeed, among timid hsteners, of whom there are \nnowadays a very great number, he is henceforth considered dangerous. It is as if, in \nhis rejection of scepticism, they seemed to hear some evil, menacing sound from \nafar, as if some new explosive were being tested somewhere, a dynamite of the \nspirit, perhaps a newly discovered Russian nihihne, a pessimism bonae voluntatis \nwhich does not merely say No, will No, but — dreadful thought! does No. Against \nthis kind of ‘good will’ — a will to the actual active denial of hfe — there is today \nconfessedly no better sedative and soporific than scepticism, the gentle, gracious, \nlulhng poppy scepticism; and even Hamlet is prescribed by the doctors of our time \nagainst the ‘spirit’ and its noises under the ground. “Are our ears not already filled \nwith nasty sounds?’ says the sceptic as a friend of sleep and almost as a kind of \nsecurity pohce: ‘this subterranean No is terrible! Be quiet, you pessimistic moles!’ \nFor the sceptic, that dehcate creature, is all too easily frightened; his conscience i\nschooled to wince at every No, indeed even at a hard decisive Yes, and to sense \nsomething hke a sting. Yes! and No! — that is to him contrary to morahty; on the \nother hand, he hkes his virtue to enjoy a noble continence, perhaps by saying after \nMontaigne ‘What do I know? Or after Socrates: ‘I know that I know nothing.’ Or: \n‘Here I do not trust myself, here no door stands open to me.’ Or: ‘If it did stand \nopen, why go straight in?’ Or: ‘What is the point of hasty hypotheses? To make no \nhypothesis at all could well be a part of good taste. Do you absolutely have to go \nstraightening out what is crooked? Absolutely have to stop up every hole with \noakum? Is there not plenty of time? Does time not have time? Oh you rogues, are \nyou unable to wait? Uncertainty too has its charms, the sphinx too is a Circe, Circe \ntoo was a philosopher.’ — Thus does a sceptic console himself; and it is true he \nstands in need of some consolation. For scepticism is the most spiritual expression \nof a certain complex physiological condition called in ordinary language nervous \ndebihty and sickhness; it arises whenever races or classes long separated from one \nanother are decisively and suddenly crossed. In the new generation, which has as it \nwere inherited varying standards and values in its blood, all is unrest, disorder, \ndoubt, experiment; the most vital forces have a retarding effect, the virtues \nthemselves will not let one another grow and become strong, equihbrium, centre of \nbalance, upright certainty are lacking in body and soul. But that which becomes \nmost profoundly sick and degenerates in such hybrids is the will: they no longer \nhave any conception of independence of decision, of the vahant feehng of pleasure \nin wilhng — even in their dreams they doubt the ‘freedom of the will’. Our Europe \nof today, the scene of a senselessly sudden attempt at radical class — and \nconsequently race — mixture, is as a result sceptical from top to bottom, now with \nthat agile scepticism which springs impatiently and greedily from branch to branch, \nnow gloomily hke a cloud overcharged with question-marks — and often sick to \ndeath of its will! Paralysis of will: where does one not find this cripple sitting toda\nAnd frequently so dressed up! How seductively dressed up! There is the lovehest \nfalse finery available for this disease; and that most of that which appears in the \nshop windows today as ‘objectivity’, ‘scientificahty’, l'art pour l'art’, ‘pure will-l\nknowledge’ is merely scepticism and will-paralysis dressed up — for this diagnosis of \nthe European sickness I am wilhng to go bail. — Sickness of will is distributed over \n\n\nEurope unequally: it appears most virulently and abundantly where culture has been \nlongest, indigenous it dechnes according to the extent to which ‘the barbarian’ still \nor again — asserts his rights under the loose-fitting garment of Westem culture. In \npresent-day France, consequently, as one can as easily deduce as actually see, the \nwill is sickest; and France, which has always possessed a masterly adroitness in \ntransforming even the most fateful crises of its spirit into something charming and \nseductive, today really demonstrates its cultural ascendency over Europe as the \nschool and showcase for all the fascinations of scepticism. The strength to will, and \nto will one thing for a long time, is somewhat stronger already in Germany, and \nstronger again in the north of Germany than in the centre of Germany; considerably \nstronger in England, Spain and Corsica, there in association with dullness, here with \nhardness of head — not to speak of Italy, which is too young to know what it wants \nand first has to prove whether it is capable of wilhng — but strongest of all and most\nastonishing in that huge empire-in-between, where Europe as it were flows back \ninto Asia, in Russia. There the strength to will has for long been stored up and kept \nin reserve, there the will is waiting menacingly — uncertain whether it is a will to \ndeny or a will to affirm — in readiness to discharge itself, to borrow one of the \nphysicists’ favourite words. It may need not only wars in India and Asian \ninvolvements to reheve Europe of the greatest danger facing it, but also intemal \neruptions, the explosion of the empire into small fragments, and above all the \nintroduction of the parhamentary imbecihty, including the obhgation upon everyone \nto read his newspaper at breakfast. I do not say this because I desire it: the reverse \nwould be more after my heart — I mean such an increase in the Russian threat that \nEurope would have to resolve to become equally threatening, namely to acquire a \nsingle will by means of a new caste dominating all Europe, a protracted terrible will \nof its own which could set its objectives thousands of years ahead — so that the longdrawn-out comedy of its petty states and the divided will of its dynasties and \ndemocracies should finally come to an end. The time for petty pohtics is past: the \nvery next century will bring with it the struggle for mastery over the whole earth — \nthe compulsion to grand pohtics."

That \nunscrupulous enthusiast for tall handsome grenadiers who, as king of Prussia, \nbrought into existence a mihtary and sceptical genius — and therewith at bottom that \nnew type of German which has just triumphantly emerged — the questionable mad \nfather of Frederick the Great, himself had on one point the grasp and lucky clutch \nof genius: he knew what was then lacking in Germany and which deficiency was a \nhundred times more alarming and pressing than any deficiency in culture or social \npohsh — his antipathy for the youthful Frederick was the product of a deep \ninstinctual fear. Men were lacking; and he suspected, with the bitterest vexation, that\n\n\nhis own son was not enough of a man. In that he was deceived: but who would not \nhave been deceived in his place? He saw his son lapse into the atheism, the esprit, \nthe pleasure-seeking frivohty of ingenious Frenchmen — he saw in the background \nthe great blood-sucker, the spider scepticism, he suspected the incurable \nwretchedness of a heart which is no longer hard enough for evil or for good, of a \nbroken will which no longer commands, can no longer command. But in the \nmeantime there grew up in his son that more dangerous and harder new species of \nscepticism — who knows to what extent favoured by precisely the father's hatred and \nthe icy melancholy of a will sent into sohtude? — the scepticism of audacious \nmanhness, which is related most closely to genius for war and conquest and which \nfirst entered Germany in the person of the great Frederick. This scepticism despises \nand yet grasps to itself; it undermines and takes into possession; it does not beheve \nbut retains itself; it gives perilous hberty to the spirit but it keeps firm hold on t\nheart; it is the German form of scepticism which, as a continuation of Frederickism intensified into the most spiritual domain, for a long time brought Europe under \nthe dominion of the German spirit and its critical and historical mistrust. Thanks to \nthe indomitably strong and tough mascuhnity of the great German philologists and \ncritical historians (who, seen aright, were also one and all artists in destruction and\ndisintegration), there became estabhshed, gradually and in spite of all the \nromanticism in music and philosophy, a new conception of the German spirit in \nwhich the trait of manly scepticism decisively predominated: whether as intrepidity \nof eye, as bravery and stemness of dissecting hand, or as tenacious will for perilous \nvoyages of discovery, for North Pole expeditions of the spirit beneath desolate and \ndangerous skies. There may be good reason for warm-blooded and superficial \nhumanitarians to cross themselves before precisely this spirit: cet esprit fatahste, \nironique, mephistophehque Michelet calls it, not without a shudder. But if one \nwishes to appreciate what a mark of distinction is this fear of the ‘man’ in the \nGerman spirit through which Europe was awoken from its “dogmatic slumber’, one \nmight hke to recall the earher conception which it had to overcome — and how it is \nnot very long since a mascuhnized woman could, with unbridled presumption, \nventure to commend the Germans to Europe's sympathy as gentle, good-hearted, \nweak-willed and poetic dolts. One should at last have a sufficiently profound \ncomprehension of Napoleon's astonishment when he caught sight of Goethe: it \nbetrays what had for centuries been thought was meant by the ‘German spirit’. \n‘Voila un homme!’ — which is to say: ‘but that is a man!

Will they, in \n\n\ntheir passion for knowledge, have to go further with audacious and painful \nexperiments than the tender and pampered taste of a democratic century can \napprove of? — There can be no doubt that these coming men will want to dispense \nleast with those serious and not indubious quahties which distinguish the critic from \nthe sceptic: I mean certainty in standards of value, conscious employment of a unity \nof method, instructed courage, independence and abihty to justify oneself; indeed, \nthey confess to taking a pleasure in negating and dissecting and to a certain selfpossessed cruelty which knows how to wield the knife with certainty and deftness \neven when the heart bleeds. They will be harder (and perhaps not always only \nagainst themselves) than humane men might wish, they will not consort with ‘truth’ \nso as to be ‘pleased’ by it or ‘elevated’ and ‘inspired’ — they will rather be httle \ndisposed to beheve that truth of all things should be attended by such pleasures. \nThey will smile, these stem spirits, if someone should say in their presence: “This \nthought elevates me: how should it not be true?’ Or: “This work dehghts me: how \nshould it not be beautiful? Or: ‘This artist enlarges me: how should he not be great? \n— perhaps they will have not only a smile but a feehng of genuine disgust for all \nsuch fawning enthusiasm, ideahsm, feminism, hermaphroditism, and he who could \npenetrate into the secret chambers of their hearts would hardly discover there the \nintention of reconcihng ‘Christian feehngs’ with ‘classical taste’ and perhaps even \nwith ‘modem parhamentarianism’ (as such a concihatory spirit is said to exist even \namong philosophers in our very uncertain and consequently concihatory century). \nCritical disciphne and every habit conducive to cleanhness and severity in things of \nthe spirit will be demanded by these philosophers not only of themselves: they could \neven display them as their kind of decoration — none the less they still do not want \nto be called critics on that account. It seems to them no small insult to philosophy \nwhen it is decreed, as is so happily done today: ‘Philosophy itself is criticism and \ncritical science — and nothing whatever besides!’ This evaluation of philosophy may \nenjoy the applause of every positivist in France and Germany ( — and it might \npossibly have flattered the heart and taste of Kant: one should recall the titles of hi\nprincipal works): our new philosophers will still say: critics are the philosophers’ \ninstruments and for that reason very far from being philosophers themselves! Even \nthe great Chinaman of Königsberg was only a great critic. —"

It may be required for the education of a philosopher \nthat he himself has also once stood on all those steps on which his servants, the \nscientific labourers of philosophy, remain standing — have to remain standing; he \nhimself must perhaps have been critic and sceptic and dogmatist and historian and, \nin addition, poet and collector and traveller and reader of riddles and morahst and \nseer and ‘free spirit’ and practically everything, so as to traverse the whole range of\nhuman values and value-feehngs and be able to gaze from the heights into every \ndistance, from the depths into every height, from the nook-and-comer into every \n\n\nbroad expanse with manifold eyes and a manifold conscience. But all these are only \npreconditions of his task: this task itself demands something different — it demands \nthat he create values. Those philosophical labourers after the noble exemplar of \nKant and Hegel have to take some great fact of evaluation — that is to say, former \nassessments of value, creations of value which have become dominant and are for a \nwhile called ‘truths’ — and identify them and reduce them to formulas, whether in \nthe realm of logic or of pohtics (morals) or of art.

By laying the knife vivisectionally to the \nbosom of the very virtues of the age they betrayed what was their own secret: to \nknow a new greatness of man, a new untrodden path to his enlargement. Each time \nthey revealed how much hypocrisy, indolence, letting oneself go and letting oneself \nfall, how much falsehood was concealed under the most honoured type of their \ncontemporary morahty, how much virtue was outhved; each time they said: “We \nhave to go thither, out yonder, where you today are least at home.’ In face of a \nworld of ‘modem ideas’ which would hke to banish everyone into a comer and \n‘speciahty’, a philosopher, assuming there could be philosophers today, would be \ncompelled to see the greatness of man, the concept ‘greatness’, precisely in his \nspaciousness and multiphcity, in his wholeness in diversity: he would even \ndetermine value and rank according to how much and how many things one could \nendure and take upon oneself, how far one could extend one's responsibihty. Today \nthe taste of the age and the virtue of the age weakens and attenuates the will, \nnothing is so completely timely as weakness of will: consequently, in the \nphilosopher's ideal precisely strength of will, the hardness and capacity for \nprotracted decisions, must constitute part of the concept ‘greatness’; with just as \n\n\nmuch justification as the opposite doctrine and the ideal of a shy, renunciatory, \nhumble, selfless humanity was appropriate to an opposite age, to one such as, hke \nthe sixteenth century, suffered from its accumulation of will and the stormiest \nwaters and flood-tides of selfishness. In the age of Socrates, among men of nothing \nbut wearied instincts, among conservative ancient Athenians who let themselves go \n— ‘towards happiness’, as they said, towards pleasure, as they behaved — and who at \nthe same time had in their mouth the old pretentious words to which their hves had \nlong ceased to give them any right, irony was perhaps required for greatness of soul, \nthat Socratic mahcious certitude of the old physician and plebeian who cut \nremorselessly into his own flesh as he did into the flesh and heart of the ‘noble’, wit\na look which said distinctly enough: ‘do not dissemble before me! Here — we are \nequal!’ Today, conversely, when the herd animal alone obtains and bestows honours \nin Europe, when ‘equahty of rights’ could all too easily change into equahty in \nwrongdoing: I mean into a general war on everything rare, strange, privileged, the \nhigher man, the higher soul, the higher duty, the higher responsibihty, creative \nfullness of power and mastery — today, being noble, wanting to be by oneself, the \nabihty to be different, independence and the need for self-responsibihty pertains to \nthe concept ‘greatness’; and the philosopher will betray something of his ideal when \nhe asserts: ‘He shall be the greatest who can be the most sohtary, the most \nconcealed, the most divergent, the man beyond good and evil, the master of his \nvirtues, the superabundant of will; this shall be called greatness: the abihty to be a\nmanifold as whole, as vast as full.’ And, to ask it again: is greatness — possible \ntoday?"

Thus, for example, that genuinely philosophical \ncombination of a bold exuberant spirituahty which runs presto and a dialectical \nseverity and necessity which never takes a false step is to most thinkers and scholars \nunknown from experience and consequently, if someone should speak of it in their \npresence, incredible. They imagine every necessity as a state of distress, as a painful\ncompelled conformity and constraint; and thought itself they regard as something \nslow, hesitant, almost as toil and often as ‘worthy of the sweat of the noble’ — and \nnot at all as something easy, divine, and a closest relation of high spirits and the \ndance! ‘Thinking and ‘taking something seriously’, giving it ‘weighty consideration’ \n— to them these things go together: that is the only way they have ‘experienced’ it. \nArtists may here have a more subtle scent: they know only too well that it is \nprecisely when they cease to act ‘voluntarily’ and do everything of necessity that \ntheir feehng of freedom, subtlety, fullness of power, creative placing, disposing, \nshaping reaches its height — in short, that necessity and ‘freedom of will’ are then \n\n\none in them.

The past of every form and mode of hfe, of cultures \nthat formerly lay close beside or on top of one another, streams into us ‘modem \nsouls’ thanks to this minghng, our instincts now run back in all directions, we \nourselves are a kind of chaos — : in the end, as I said before, ‘the spirit’ perceives \nadvantage in all this. Through our semi-barbarism in body and desires we have \nsecret access everywhere such as a noble age never had, above all the access to the \nlabyrinth of unfinished cultures and to every semi-barbarism which has ever existed \non earth; and, in so far as the most considerable part of human culture hitherto has \nbeen semi-barbarism, ‘historical sense’ means virtually the sense and instinct for \neverything, the taste and tongue for everything: which at once proves it to be an \nignoble sense. We enjoy Homer again, for instance: perhaps it is our happiest \nadvance that we know how to appreciate Homer, whom the men of a noble culture \n(the French of the seventeenth century, for example, such as Saint-Evremond, who \nreproached him for his esprit vaste, and even their dying echo, Voltaire) cannot and \ncould not assimilate so easily — whom they hardly permitted themselves to enjoy. \nThe very definite Yes and No of their palate, their easily aroused disgust, their \nhesitant reserve with regard to everything strange, their horror of the tastelessness \neven of a hvely curiosity, and in general that unwilhngness of a noble and selfsufficient culture to admit to a new desire, a dissatisfaction with one's own culture, \nan admiration for what is foreign: all this disposes them unfavourably towards even \nthe best things in the world which are not their property and could not become their \nprey — and no sense is so unintelhgible to such men as the historical sense and its \nobsequious plebeian curiosity. It is no different with Shakespeare, that astonishing \nSpanish-Moorish-Saxon synthesis of tastes over which an ancient Athenian of the \ncircle of Aeschylus would have half-killed himself with laughter or annoyance: but \nwe — we accept precisely this confusion of colours, this medley of the most dehcate, \nthe coarsest and the most artificial, with a secret confidence and cordiahty, we enjoy\nhim as an artistic refinement reserved precisely for us and allow ourselves to be as \nhttle disturbed by the repellent fumes and the proximity of the Enghsh rabble in \nwhich Shakespeare's art and taste hve as we do on the Chiaja of Naples, where we \ngo our way enchanted and wilhng with all our senses alert, however much the \nsewers of the plebeian quarters may fill the air. That as men of the ‘historical sense’\nwe have our virtues is not to be denied — we are unpretentious, selfless, modest, \nbrave, full of self-restraint, full of devotion, very grateful, very patient, very \naccommodating — with all that, we are perhaps not very ‘tasteful’. Let us finally \nconfess it to ourselves: that which we men of the ‘historical sense’ find hardest to \ngrasp, to feel, taste, love, that which at bottom finds us prejudiced and almost \nhostile, is just what is complete and wholly mature in every art and culture, that \nwhich constitutes actual nobihty in works and in men, their moment of smooth sea \nand halcyon self-sufficiency, the goldness and coldness displayed by all things which \nhave become perfect. Perhaps our great virtue of the historical sense necessarily \nstands opposed to good taste, or to the very best taste at any rate, and it is precisel\nthe brief httle pieces of good luck and transfiguration of human hfe that here and \nthere come flashing up which we find most difficult and laboursome to evoke in \nourselves: those miraculous moments when a great power voluntarily halted before \nthe boundless and immeasurable — when a superfluity of subtle dehght in sudden \nrestraint and petrifaction, in standing firm and fixing oneself, was enjoyed on a \nground still trembhng.

It is important that as few people as \npossible should think about morahty — consequently it is very important that \nmorahty should not one day become interesting! But do not worry! It is still now as \nit has always been: I see no one in Europe who has (or propagates) any idea that \nthinking about morahty could be dangerous, insidious, seductive — that fatahty \ncould be involved! Consider, for example, the indefatigable, inevitable Enghsh \nutihtarians and with what clumsy and worthy feet they walk, stalk (a Homeric \nmetaphor says it more plainly) along in the footsteps of Bentham, just as he himself \nhad walked in the footsteps of the worthy Helvétius (no, he was not a dangerous \nman, this Helvétius, ce senateur Pococurante as Gahani called him — ). No new idea, \nno subtle expression or tum of an old idea, not even a real history of what had been \nthought before: an impossible hterature altogether, unless one knows how to leaven \nit with a httle mahce. For into these morahsts too (whom one has to read with \nmental reservations if one has to read them at all — ) there has crept that old Enghsh\nvice called cant, which is moral tartuffery, this time concealed in the new form of \nscientificahty; there are also signs of a secret struggle with pangs of conscience, \nfrom which a race of former Puritans will naturally suffer. (Is a morahst not the \nopposite of a Puritan? That is to say, as a thinker who regards morahty as \nsomething questionable, as worthy of question-marks, in short as a problem? Is \nmorahzing not — immoral?) Ultimately they all want Enghsh morahty to prevail: \ninasmuch as mankind, or the ‘general utihty’, or ‘the happiness of the greatest \nnumber’, no! the happiness of England would best be served; they would hke with \n\n\nall their might to prove to themselves that to strive after Enghsh happiness, I mean \nafter comfort and fashion (and, as the supreme goal, a seat in Parhament), is at the \nsame time the true path of virtue, indeed that all virtue there has ever been on earth \nhas consisted in just such a striving. Not one of all these ponderous herd animals \nwith their uneasy conscience (who undertake to advocate the cause of egoism as the \ncause of the general welfare — ) wants to know or scent that the ‘general welfare’ is \nnot an ideal, or a goal, or a concept that can be grasped at all, but only an emetic — \nthat what is right for one cannot by any means therefore be right for another, that \nthe demand for one morahty for all is detrimental to precisely the higher men, in \nshort that there exists an order of rank between man and man, consequently also \nbetween morahty and morahty. They are a modest and thoroughly mediocre species \nof man, these Enghsh utihtarians, and, as aforesaid, in so far as they are boring one\ncannot think sufficiently highly of their utihty. One ought even to encourage them: \nwhich is in part the objective of the following rhymes. \nHail, continual plodders, hail! \n‘Lengthen out the tedious tale’, \nPedant still in head and knee, \nDull, of humour not a trace, \nPermanently commonplace, \nSans génie et sans esprit!"

Perhaps I am risking something when I let one of these truths escape: let \nothers capture it again and give it sufficient of the ‘milk of pious thoughts’ for it t\nhe still and forgotten in its old comer. — One should open one's eyes and take a new \nlook at cruelty; one should at last grow impatient, so that the kind of immodest fat \nerrors which have, for example, been fostered about tragedy by ancient and modem \nphilosophers should no longer go stalking virtuously and confidently about. Almost \neverything we call ‘higher culture’ is based on the spirituahzation and intensificatio\nof cruelty — this is my proposition; the ‘wild beast’ has not been laid to rest at all,\nhves, it flourishes, it has merely become — deified. That which constitutes the \npainful voluptuousness of tragedy is cruelty; that which produces a pleasing effect in \nso-called tragic pity, indeed fundamentally in everything subhme up to the highest \nand most refined thrills of metaphysics, derives its sweetness solely from the \n\n\ningredient of cruelty mixed in with it. What the Roman in the arena, the Christian \nin the ecstasies of the Cross, the Spaniard watching bumings or bullfights, the \nJapanese of today crowding in to the tragedy, the Parisian suburban workman who \nhas a nostalgia for bloody revolutions, the Wagnerienne who, with will suspended, \n‘experiences’ Tristan und Isolde — what all of these enjoy and look with secret \nardour to imbibe is the spicy potion of the great Circe ‘cruelty’. Here, to be sure, we\nmust put aside the thick-witted psychology of former times which had to teach of \ncruelty only that it had its origin in the sight of the sufferings of others: there is \nan abundant, over-abundant enjoyment of one's own suffering, of making oneself \nsuffer — and wherever man allows himself to be persuaded to self-denial in the \nrehgious sense, or to self-mutilation, as among Phoenicians and ascetics, or in \ngeneral to desensuahzation, decamahzation, contrition, to Puritanical spasms of \nrepentance, to conscience-vivisection and to a Pascahan sacrifizio dell’ intelletto, h\nis secretly lured and urged onward by his cruelty, by the dangerous thrills of cruelty \ndirected against himself. Consider, finally, how even the man of knowledge, when \nhe compels his spirit to knowledge which is counter to the inchnation of his spirit \nand frequently also to the desires of his heart — by saying No, that is, when he \nwould hke to affirm, love, worship — disposes as an artist in and transfigurer of \ncruelty; in all taking things seriously and thoroughly, indeed, there is already a \nviolation, a desire to hurt the fundamental will of the spirit, which ceaselessly \nstrives for appearance and the superficial — in all desire to know there is already a \ndrop of cruelty."

      "text": "Perhaps what I have said here of a ‘fundamental will of the spirit may not be \nimmediately comprehensible: allow me to explain. — That commanding something \nwhich the people calls ‘spirit’ wants to be master within itself and around itself and \nto feel itself master: out of multiphcity it has the will to simphcity, a will which \nbinds together and tames, which is imperious and domineering. In this its needs and \nCapacities are the same as those which physiologists posit for everything that hves, \ngrows and multiphes. The power of the spirit to appropriate what is foreign to it is \nrevealed in a strong inchnation to assimilate the new to the old, to simphfy the \ncomplex, to overlook or repel what is wholly contradictory: just as it arbitrarily \nemphasizes, extracts and falsifies to suit itself certain traits and hnes in what is \nforeign to it, in every piece of ‘extemal world’. Its intention in all this is the \nincorporation of new ‘experiences’, the arrangement of new things within old \ndivisions — growth, that is to say; more precisely, the feehng of growth, the feehng \nof increased power. This same will is served by an apparently antithetical drive of \nthe spirit, a sudden decision for ignorance, for arbitrary shutting-out, a closing of \nthe windows, an inner denial of this or that thing, a refusal to let it approach, a kin\nof defensive posture against much that can be known, a contentment with the dark, \nwith the closed horizon, an acceptance and approval of ignorance: all this being \nnecessary according to the degree of its power to appropriate, its ‘digestive power’, \nto speak in a metaphor — and indeed ‘the spirit’ is more hke a stomach than anything \nelse. It is here that there also belongs the occasional will of the spirit to let itsel\n\n\ndeceived, perhaps with a mischievous notion that such and such is not the case, that \nit is only being allowed to pass for the case, a joy in uncertainty and ambiguity, an \nexultant enjoyment of the capricious narrowness and secrecy of a nook-and-comer, \nof the all too close, of the foreground, of the exaggerated, diminished, displaced, \nbeautified, an enjoyment of the capriciousness of all these expressions of power. \nFinally there also belongs here that not altogether innocent readiness of the spirit to\ndeceive other spirits and to dissemble before them, that continual pressing and \npushing of a creative, formative, changeable force: in this the spirit enjoys the \nmultiphcity and cunning of its masks, it enjoys too the sense of being safe that this \nbrings — for it is precisely through its protean arts that it is best concealed and \nprotected! This will to appearance, to simphfication, to the mask, to the cloak, in \nshort to the superficial — for every surface is a cloak — is counteracted by that \nsubhme inchnation in the man of knowledge which takes a profound, many-sided \nand thorough view of things and will take such a view: as a kind of cruelty of the \nintellectual conscience and taste which every brave thinker will recognize in \nhimself, provided he has hardened and sharpened for long enough his own view of \nhimself, as he should have, and is accustomed to stem disciphne and stem language. \nHe will say ‘there is something cruel in the inchnation of my spirit’ — let the amiabl\nand virtuous try to talk him out of that! In fact, it would be nicer if, instead of wit\ncruelty, we were perhaps credited with an “extravagant honesty’ — we free, very free \nspirits — and perhaps that will actually one day be our posthumous fame? In the \nmeantime — for it will be a long time before that happens — we ourselves are hkely \nto be least inchned to dress up in morahstic verbal tinsel and valences of this sort:\nall our labour hitherto has spoiled us for this taste and its buoyant luxuriousness. \nThey are beautiful, ghttering, jinghng, festive words: honesty, love of truth, love o\nwisdom, sacrifice for the sake of knowledge, heroism of the truthful — there is \nsomething about them that makes one's pride swell. But we hermits and marmots \nlong ago became convinced that this worthy verbal pomp too belongs among the \nancient false finery, lumber and gold-dust of unconscious human vanity, and that \nunder such flattering colours and vamish too the terrible basic text homo natura \nmust again be discemed. For to translate man back into nature; to master the many \nvain and fanciful interpretations and secondary meanings which have been hitherto \nscribbled and daubed over that etemal basic text homo natura; to confront man \nhenceforth with man in the way in which, hardened by the disciphne of science, \nman today confronts the rest of nature, with dauntless Oedipus eyes and stopped-up \nOdysseus ears, deaf to the siren songs of old metaphysical bird-catchers who have \nall too long been piping to him ‘you are more! you are higher! you are of a different \norigin!’ — that may be a strange and extravagant task but it is a task — who would \ndeny that? Why did we choose it, this extravagant task? Or, to ask the question \ndifferently: ‘why knowledge at all?’ — Everyone will ask us about that. And we, thus \npressed, we who have asked ourselves the same question a hundred times, we have \nfound and can find no better answer..."

For what must these clumsy attempts on the part of female \nscientificahty and self-exposure not bring to hght! Woman has so much reason for \nshame; in woman there is concealed so much pedanticism, superficiahty, \nschoolmarmishness, petty presumption, petty unbridledness and petty immodesty — \none needs only to study her behaviour with children! — which has fundamentally \nbeen most effectively controlled and repressed hitherto by fear of man. Woe when \nthe ‘etemal-boring in woman’ — she has plenty of that! — is allowed to venture forth! \nWhen she begins radically and on principle to forget her arts and best pohcy: those \nof charm, play, the banishing of care, the assuaging of grief and taking hghtly, \ntogether with her subtle aptitude for agreeable desires! Already female voices are \nraised which, by holy Aristophanes! make one tremble; there are threatening and \nmedically exphcit statements of what woman wants of man. Is it not in the worst of \ntaste when woman sets about becoming scientific in that fashion? Enhghtenment in \nthis field has hitherto been the affair and endowment of men — we remained ‘among \nourselves’ in this; and whatever women write about ‘woman’, we may in the end \nreserve a good suspicion as to whether woman really wants or can want \nenhghtenment about herself... Unless a woman is looking for a new adomment for \nherself in this way — self-adomment pertains to the etemal-womanly, does it not? — \nshe is trying to inspire fear of herself — perhaps she is seeking dominion. But she \ndoes not want truth: what is truth to a woman! From the very first nothing has been \nmore ahen, repugnant, inimical to woman than truth — her great art is the he, her \nsupreme concem is appearance and beauty. Let us confess it, we men: it is precisely \nthis art and this instinct in woman which we love and honour: we who have a hard \ntime and for our refreshment hke to associate with creatures under whose hands, \nglances and tender folhes our seriousness, our gravity and profundity appear to us \nalmost as folly. Finally I pose the question: has any woman ever conceded \nprofundity to a woman's mind or justice to a woman's heart? And is it not true that \n\n\non the whole ‘woman’ has hitherto been shghted most by woman herself — and not \nat all by us? — We men want woman to cease compromising herself through \nenhghtenment: just as it was man's care and consideration for woman which led the \nChurch to decree: muher taceat in ecclesia! It was to the benefit of woman when \nNapoleon gave the all too eloquent Madame de Staël to understand: muher taceat in \npohticis! — and I think it is a true friend of women who calls on them today: muher \ntaceat de muhere!"

She wants more, she leams to demand, in the end she finds this tribute of \nrespect almost offensive, she would prefer competition for rights, indeed a real \nstand-up fight: enough, woman loses in modesty. Let us add at once that she also \nloses in taste. She unleams fear of man: but the woman who ‘unleams fear’ \nsacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should venture out when the \nfear-inspiring in man, let us put it more precisely and say the man in man, is no \nlonger desired and developed, is fair enough, also comprehensible enough; what is \nharder to comprehend is that, through precisely this fact — woman degenerates. This \nis what is happening today: let us not deceive ourselves! Wherever the spirit of \nindustry has triumphed over the mihtary and aristocratic spirit woman now aspires \nto the economic and legal independence of a clerk: ‘woman as clerk’ stands \ninscribed on the portal of the modem society now taking shape. As she thus seizes \nnew rights, looks to become ‘master’, and inscribes the ‘progress’ of woman on her \nflags and banners, the reverse is happening with dreadful clarity: woman is \nretrogressing. Since the French Revolution the influence of woman in Europe has \ngrown less in the same proportion as her rights and claims have grown greater; and \nthe ‘emancipation of woman’, in so far as it has been demanded and advanced by \nwomen themselves (and not only by male shallow-pates), is thus revealed as a \nnoteworthy symptom of the growing enfeeblement and blunting of the most \nfeminine instincts. There is stupidity in this movement, an almost mascuhne \nstupidity, of which a real woman — who is always a clever woman — would have to \nbe ashamed from the very heart. To lose her sense for the ground on which she is \nmost sure of victory; to neglect to practise the use of her own proper weapons; to let \nherself go before the man, perhaps even ‘to the extent of producing a book’, where \nformerly she kept herself in check and in subtle cunning humihty; to seek with \nvirtuous assurance to destroy man's behef that a fundamentally different ideal is \nwrapped up in woman, that there is something etemally, necessarily feminine; \nemphatically and loquaciously to talk man out of the idea that woman has to be \nmaintained, cared for, protected, indulged hke a dehcate, strangely wild and often \nagreeable domestic animal; the clumsy and indignant parade of all of slavery and \nbondage that woman's position in the order of society has hitherto entailed and still \nentails (as if slavery were a counter-argument and not rather a condition of every \nhigher culture, of every enhancement of culture) — what does all this mean if not a \ncrumbhng of the feminine instinct, a defeminizing? To be sure, there are sufficient \nidiotic friends and corrupters of woman among the leamed asses of the male sex \nwho advise woman to defeminize herself in this fashion and to imitate all the \n\n\nstupidities with which ‘man’ in Europe, European ‘manhness’, is sick — who would \nhke to reduce woman to the level of ‘general education’, if not to that of newspaper \nreading and playing at pohtics. Here and there they even want to tum women into \nfree-spirits and hterati: as if a woman without piety would not be something utterly \nrepellent or ludicrous to a profound and godless man —; almost everywhere her \nnerves are being shattered by the most morbid and dangerous of all the varieties of \nmusic (our latest German music), and she is being rendered more and more \nhysterical with every day that passes and more and more incapable of her first and \nlast profession, which is to bear strong children. There is a desire to make her in \ngeneral more ‘cultivated’ and, as they say, to make the ‘weak sex’ strong through \nculture: as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner possible that \nmaking human beings ‘cultivated’ and making them weaker — that is to say, \nenfeebhng, fragmenting, contaminating, the force of the will, have always gone hand \nin hand, and that the world's most powerful and influential women (most recently \nthe mother of Napoleon) owed their power and ascendancy over men precisely to \nthe force of their will — and not to schoolmasters! That in woman which inspires \nrespect and fundamentally fear is her nature, which is more ‘natural’ than that of the \nman, her genuine, cunning, beast-of-prey suppleness, the tiger's claws beneath the \nglove, the naivety of her egoism, her ineducabihty and inner savagery, and how \nincomprehensible, capacious and prowhng her desires and virtues are... That \nwhich, all fear notwithstanding, evokes pity for this dangerous and beautiful cat \n‘woman’ is that she appears to be more affhcted, more vulnerable, more in need of \nlove and more condemned to disappointment than any other animal. Fear and pity: \nit is with these feehngs that man has hitherto stood before woman, always with one \nfoot in tragedy, which lacerates as it dehghts. — What?

More ponderous spirits than we may have \ndone with what in our case is confined to a few hours and is then over only after a \nlonger period: one takes half a year, another half a hfe, according to the speed and \npower with which he digests it and of his ‘metabohsm’. Indeed, I can imagine dull, \nsluggish races which, even in our fast-moving Europe, would need half a century to \novercome such atavistic attacks of patriotism and cleaving to one's native soil and to \nbe restored to reason, I mean to ‘good Europeanism’. And, while digressing on this \npossibihty, I chanced to become the ear-witness of a conversation between two old \n‘patriots’ — it is clear they were both hard of hearing and thus spoke all the louder. \n‘He has and knows as much philosophy as a peasant or a fratemity student’, said one \nof them: ‘he is still innocent. But what does that matter nowadays! It is the age of \nthe masses: they fall on their faces before anything massive. And in pohtics hkewise.\nA statesman who builds for them another Tower of Babel, some monstrosity of \nempire and power, they call “great” — what does it matter if we, more cautious and \nreserved than they, persist in the old behef that it is the great idea alone which can\nbestow greatness on a deed or a cause. Suppose a statesman were to put his nation \nin the position of having henceforth to pursue “grand pohtics”, for which it was ill \nequipped and badly prepared by nature, so that it had to sacrifice its old and sure \nvirtues for the sake of a new and doubtful mediocrity -suppose a statesman were to \ncondemn his nation to “pohticizing” at all, while that nation had hitherto had \nsomething better to do and think about and in the depths of its soul still retained a \ncautious disgust for the restlessness, emptiness and noisy wranghng of those nations \nwhich actually do practise pohtics — suppose such a statesman were to goad the \nslumbering passions and desires of his nation, tum its former diffidence and desire \n\n\nto stand aside into a stigma and its predilection for foreign things and its secret \ninfiniteness into a fault, devalue its most heartfelt inchnations in its own eyes, \nreverse its conscience, make its mind narrow and its taste “national” — what! a \nstatesman who did all this, a statesman for whom his nation would have to atone for \nall future time, assuming it had a future — would such a statesman be great?’ \n‘Undoubtedly!’ the other patriot rephed vehemently: ‘otherwise he would not have \nbeen able to do it! Perhaps you may say it was mad to want to do such a thing? But \nperhaps everything great has been merely mad to begin with!’ — ‘Misuse of words!’ \ncried the other: — ‘strong! strong! strong and mad! Not great!’ — The old men had \nobviously grown heated as they thus shouted their ‘truths’ in one another's faces; I, \nhowever, in my happiness and beyond, considered how soon a stronger will become \nmaster of the strong; and also that when one nation becomes spiritually shallower \nthere is a compensation for it: another nation becomes deeper. —"

This process of the becoming European, the tempo of which can be \nretarded by great relapses but which will perhaps precisely through them gain in \nvehemence and depth — the still-raging storm and stress of ‘national feehng’ belongs \nhere, hkewise the anarchism now emerging —: this process will probably lead to \nresults which its naive propagators and panegyrists, the apostles of ‘modem ideas’, \nwould be least inchned to anticipate. The same novel conditions which will on \naverage create a levelhng and mediocritizing of man — a useful, industrious, highly \nserviceable and able herd-animal man — are adapted in the highest degree to giving \nrise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and enticing quahty. For while that \npower of adaptation which continually tries out changing conditions and begins a \nnew labour with every new generation, almost with every new decade, cannot make \npossible the powerfulness of the type; while the total impression produced by such \nfuture Europeans will probably be that of multifarious, garrulous, weak-willed and \nhighly employable workers who need a master, a commander, as they need their \ndaily bread; while, therefore, the democratization of Europe will lead to the \nproduction of a type prepared for slavery in the subtlest sense: in individual and \nexceptional cases the strong man will be found to tum out stronger and richer than \nhas perhaps ever happened before — thanks to the unprejudiced nature of his \nschoohng, thanks to the tremendous multiphcity of practice, art and mask. What I \nmean to say is that the democratization of Europe is at the same time an involuntary \narrangement for the breeding of tyrants — in every sense of that word, including the \n\n\nmost spiritual."

      "text": "There was a time when it was usual to call the Germans ‘profound’, and this was \nmeant as a term of distinction: now, when the most successful type of the new \nGermanism thirsts after quite different honours and perhaps feels that anything \nprofound lacks ‘dash’, it is almost timely and patriotic to doubt whether that \ncommendation of former days was not founded on self-deception: whether German \nprofundity is not at bottom something different and worse — and something which, \nthanks be to God, one is on the verge of successfully getting rid of. Let us therefore \ntry to leam anew about German profundity: all that is required is a httle vivisection\nof the German soul. — The German soul is above all manifold, of diverse origins, \nput together and superimposed rather than actually constructed: the reason for that \nis its source. A German who would make bold to say ‘two souls, alas, within my \nbosom dwell would err very widely from the truth, more correctly he would fall \nshort of the truth by a large number of souls. As a people of the most tremendous \nmixture and minghng of races, perhaps even with a preponderance of the preAryan element, as the ‘people of the middle’ in every sense, the Germans are more \nincomprehensible, more comprehensive, more full of contradictions, more \nunknown, more incalculable, more surprising, even more frightening to themselves \nthan other peoples are — they elude definition and are for that reason alone the \ndespair of the French. It is characteristic of the Germans that the question ‘what is \nGerman?’ never dies out among them. Kotzebue certainly knew his Germans well \nenough: ‘we are known’ they cried to him jubilantly — but Sand too thought she \nknew them. Jean Paul knew what he was doing when he declared himself incensed \nby Fichte's mendacious but patriotic flatteries and exaggerations — but it is hkely \nthat Goethe thought otherwise of the Germans than Jean Paul did, even though he \nagreed with him about Fichte. What Goethe really thought of the Germans? — But \nthere were many things round him about which he never expressed himself clearly \nand his whole hfe long he knew how to maintain a subtle silence — he had no doubt \ngood reason. What is certain is that it was not ‘the Wars of Liberation’ which made \nhim look up more cheerfully, any more than it was the French Revolution — the \nevent on account of which he rethought his Faust, indeed the whole problem of \n‘man’, was the appearance of Napoleon. There exist statements by Goethe in which, \nas if he was from another country, he condemns with impatient severity that which \nthe Germans take pride in: the celebrated German Gemüt he once defined as \n‘indulgence of others’ weaknesses, and one's own’. Was he wrong? — it is \n\n\ncharacteristic of the Germans that one is seldom wholly wrong about them. The \nGerman soul has corridors and interconnecting corridors in it, there are caves, \nhiding-places, dungeons in it; its disorder possesses much of the fascination of the \nmysterious; the German is acquainted with the hidden paths to chaos. And as \neverything loves its symbol, the German loves clouds and all that is obscure, \nbecoming, crepuscular, damp and dismal: the uncertain, unformed, shifting, \ngrowing of every kind he feels to be ‘profound’. The German himself is not, he is \nbecoming, he is ‘developing’. ‘Development is thus the truly German discovery and \nlucky shot in the great domain of philosophical formulas — a ruhng concept which, \nin concert with German beer and German music, is at work at the Germanization of \nall Europe. Foreigners are astonished and drawn by the enigmas which the \ncontradictory nature at the bottom of the German soul propounds to them (which \nHegel reduced to a system and Richard Wagner finally set to music). ‘“Good-natured \nand mahcious’ — such a juxtaposition, nonsensical in respect of any other people, is \nunfortunately too often justified in Germany: you have only to hve among Swabians \nfor a while! The ponderousness of the German scholar, his social insipidity, gets on \nfrightfully well with an inner rope-walking and easy boldness before which all the \ngods have leamed fear. If you want the ‘German soul’ demonstrated ad oculos, you \nhave only to look into German taste, into German arts and customs: what boorish \nindifference to ‘taste’! How the noblest and the commonest here stand side by side! \nHow disorderly and wealthy this whole psychical household is! The German drags \nhis soul, he drags everything he experiences. He digests his events badly, he is never \n‘done’ with them; German profundity is often only a sluggish ‘digestion’. And just as \nall chronic invahds, all dyspeptics, have an inchnation for comfort, so the German \nloves ‘openness’ and ‘uprightness’: how comfortable it is to be open and upright! — \nPerhaps it is the most dangerous and successful disguise the German knows how to \nuse today, this confiding, accommodating, cards-on-the-table German honesty: it is \nhis real Mephistophelean art, with its aid he can ‘still go far’! The German lets \nhimself go, and as he does so he gazes out with true blue empty German eyes — and \nother countries at once confound him with his dressing-gown! — I meant to say: \nwhatever ‘German profundity’ may be — and when we are quite by ourselves we \nshall perhaps permit ourselves to laugh at it? — we would do well to hold its \nappearance and good name in respect henceforth too and not to sell former old \nreputation as the profound nation too cheaply for Prussian ‘dash’ and Berhn wit and \nsand. It is clever for a people to be considered, to get itself considered, profound, \nclumsy, good-natured, honest, not clever: it might even be — profound! Finally: one \nought not to be ashamed of one's own name -it is not for nothing one is called das \ntiusche’ Volk, das Tausche- Volk..."

Alas, some day it will all be \n\n\ngone — but who can doubt that understanding and taste for Beethoven will be gone \nfirst! — for Beethoven was only the closing cadence of a transition of style and \nstyhstic breach and not, as Mozart was, the closing cadence of a great centuries-old \nEuropean taste. Beethoven is the intermediary between an old mellow soul that is \nconstantly crumbhng and a future over-young soul that is constantly arriving; upon \nhis music there hes that twihght of etemal loss and etemal extravagant hope — the \nsame hght in which Europe lay bathed when it dreamed with Rousseau, when it \ndanced around the Revolution's Tree of Liberty and finally almost worshipped \nbefore Napoleon. But how quickly this feehng is now fading away, how hard it is \ntoday even to know of this feehng — how strange to our ears sounds the language of \nRousseau, Schiller, Shelley, Byron, in whom together the same European destiny \nthat in Beethoven knew how to sing found its way into words! — Whatever German \nmusic came afterwards belongs to romanticism, that is to say to a movement which \nwas, historically speaking, even brieter, even more fleeting, even more superficial \nthan that great interlude, that transition of Europe from Rousseau to Napoleon and \nto the rise of democracy. Weber: but what are Freischiitz and Oberon to us today! \nOr Marschner's Hans Heihng and Vampyr! Or even Wagner's Tannhäuser! It is \ndead, if not yet forgotten, music. All this music of romanticism was, moreover, \ninsufficiently noble, insufficiently musical, to maintain itself anywhere but in the \ntheatre and before the mob; it was from the very first second-rate music to which \ngenuine musicians paid httle regard. It was otherwise with Fehx Mendelssohn, that \nhalcyon master who was, on account of his hghter, purer, happier soul, speedily \nhonoured and just as speedily forgotten: as the beautiful intermezzo of German \nmusic. But as for Schumann, who took things seriously and was also taken seriously \nfrom the first — he was the last to found a school —: do we not now think it a piece \nof good fortune, a rehef, a hberation that this Schumann-romanticism has been \novercome? Schumann, fleeing into the “Saxon Switzerland’ of his soul, his nature \nhalf Werther, half Jean Paul, not at all hke Beethoven, not at all Byronic! — his \nmusic for Manfred is a mistake and misunderstanding to the point of injustice — \nSchumann, with his taste which was fundamentally a petty taste (that is to say a \ndangerous inchnation, doubly dangerous among Germans, for quiet lyricism and \ndrunkenness of feehng), continually going aside, shyly withdrawing and retiring, a \nnoble effeminate dehghting in nothing but anonymous weal and woe, a kind of girl \nand noh me tangere from the first: this Schumann was already a merely German \nevent in music, no longer a European event, as Beethoven was, as to an even greater \nextent Mozart had been — in him German music was threatened with its greatest \ndanger, that of losing the voice for the soul of Europe and sinking into a merely \nnational affair."

A \nmisunderstanding of its tempo, for example: and the sentence itself is \nmisunderstood! That one must be in no doubt about the syllables that determine the \nrhythm, that one should feel the disruption of a too-severe symmetry as intentional \nand as something attractive, that one should lend a refined and patient ear to every \nstaccato, every rubato, that one should divine the meaning in the sequence of vowels \nand diphthongs and how dehcately and richly they can colour and recolour one \nanother through the order in which they come: who among book-reading Germans \nhas sufficient goodwill to acknowledge such demands and duties and to hsten to so \nmuch art and intention in language?

      "text": "How httle German style has to do with sound and the ears is shown by the fact that \nprecisely our good musicians write badly. The German does not read aloud, does \nnot read for the ear, but merely with his eyes: he has put his ears away in the \ndrawer. In antiquity, when a man read — which he did very seldom — he read to \nhimself aloud, and indeed in a loud voice; it was a matter for surprise if someone \nread quietly, and people secretly asked themselves why he did so. In a loud voice: \nthat is to say, with all the crescendos, inflections, variations of tone and changes of\ntempo in which the ancient pubhc world took pleasure. In those days the rules of \nwritten style were the same as those of spoken style; and these rules depended in \npart on the astonishing development, the refined requirements of ear and larynx, in \npart on the strength, endurance and power of ancient lungs. A period is, in the sense \nin which the ancients understood it, above all a physiological whole, inasmuch as it \nis composed by a single breath. Periods such as appear with Demosthenes or \nCicero, rising twice and sinking twice and all within a single breath: these are \ndehghts for men of antiquity, who knew from their own schoohng how to value the \nvirtue in them, the rarity and difficulty of the dehvery of such a period — we have \nreally no right to the grand period, we modems, we who are short of breath in every \nsense! For these ancients were one and all themselves dilettantes in rhetoric, \nconsequently connoisseurs, consequently critics — and so they drove their orators to \nextremes; in the same way as, in the last century, when all Itahans and Itahennes \nknew how to sing, virtuosity in singing (and therewith also the art of melody —) \nattained its height with them. In Germany, however, there was (until very recently, \nwhen a kind of platform eloquence began shyly and heavily to flap its young wings) \nreally but one species of pubhc and fairly artistic oratory: that from the pulpit. The\npreacher was the only one in Germany who knew what a syllable, what a word \nweighs, how a sentence strikes, rises, falls, runs, runs to an end, he alone had a \n\n\nconscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience: for there is no lack of \nreasons why it is precisely the German who rarely achieves proficiency in oratory, \nor almost always achieves it too late. The masterpiece of German prose is therefore, \nas is to be expected, the masterpiece of its great preacher: the Bible has been the \nbest German book hitherto. Compared with Luther's Bible almost everything else is \nmerely ‘hterature’ — a thing that has not grown up in Germany and therefore has not \ntaken and does not take root in German hearts: as the Bible has done."

May it be forgiven \nme that I too, during a daring brief sojoum in a highly infected area, did not remain \nwholly free of the disease and began, hke the rest of the world, to entertain ideas \nabout things that were none of my business: first symptom of the pohtical infection. \nAbout the Jews, for example: hsten. — I have never met a German who was \nfavourably inchned towards the Jews; and however unconditionally all cautious and \npohtic men may have repudiated real anti-Jewism, even this caution and pohcy is \nnot directed against this class of feehng itself but only against its dangerous \nimmoderation, and especially against the distasteful and shameful way in which this \nimmoderate feehng is expressed — one must not deceive oneself about that. That \nGermany has an ample sufficiency of Jews, that the German stomach, German \nblood has difficulty (and will continue to have difficulty for a long time to come) in \nabsorbing even this quantum of ‘Jew’ — as the Itahans, the French, the Enghsh have \nabsorbed them through possessing a stronger digestion —: this is the clear \ndeclaration and language of a universal instinct to which one must pay heed, in \naccordance with which one must act. ‘Let in no more Jews! And close especially the \ndoors to the East (also to Austria)!’ — thus commands the instinct of a people whose \ntype is still weak and undetermined, so that it could easily be effaced, easily \nextinguished by a stronger race. The Jews, however, are beyond all doubt the \nstrongest, toughest and purest race at present hving in Europe; they know how to \nprevail even under the worst conditions (better even than under favourable ones), by \nmeans of virtues which one would hke to stamp as vices — thanks above all to a \nresolute faith which does not need to be ashamed before ‘modem ideas’; they \nchange, when they change, only in the way in which the Russian Empire makes its \nconquests — an empire that has time and is not of yesterday —: namely, according to \nthe principle ‘as slowly as possible’! A thinker who has the future of Europe on his \nconscience will, in all the designs he makes for this future, take the Jews into \naccount as he will take the Russians, as the immediately surest and most probable \nfactors in the great game and struggle of forces. That which is called a ‘nation’ in \nEurope today and is actually more of a res facta than nata (indeed sometimes \npositively resembles a res ficta et picta —) is in any case something growing, young, \neasily disruptable, not yet a race, let alone such an aere perennius as the Jewish type\nis: these ‘nations’ should certainly avoid all hot-headed rivalry and hostihty very \ncarefully! That the Jews could, if they wanted — or if they were compelled, as the \nanti-Semites seem to want — even now predominate, indeed quite hterally rule over \nEurope, is certain; that they are not planning and working towards that is equally \ncertain. In the meantime they are, rather, wanting and wishing, even with some \nimportunity, to be absorbed and assimilated by and into Europe, they are longing to \nbe finally settled, permitted, respected somewhere and to put an end to the nomadic \n\n\nhfe, to the “Wandering Jew’ —; one ought to pay heed to this inchnation and impulse \n(which is perhaps even a sign that the Jewish instincts are becoming milder) and go \nout to meet it: for which it would perhaps be a good idea to eject the anti-Semitic \nranters from the country. Go out to meet it with all caution, with selectivity; much \nas the Enghsh nobihty do. It is plain that the stronger and already more firmly \nformed types of the new Germanism could enter into relations with them with the \nleast hesitation; the aristocratic officer of the March, for example: it would be \ninteresting in many ways to see whether the genius of money and patience (and \nabove all a httle mind and spirituahty, of which there is a plentiful lack in the \npersons above mentioned —) could not be added and bred into the hereditary art of \ncommanding and obeying, in both of which the abovementioned land is today \nclassic.

But one must hang on with one's teeth to this \nproposition of historical equity and defend it against the prejudice of the day: \nEuropean noblesse — of feehng, of taste, of custom, in short noblesse in every \nexalted sense of the word — is the work and invention of France, European \nvulgarity, the plebeianism of modem ideas, that of — England.—"

      "text": "Even now France is still the seat of Europe's most spiritual and refined culture and \nthe leading school of taste: but one has to know how to find this ‘France of taste’. \nHe who belongs to it keeps himself well hidden — it may be only a small number in \n\n\nwhom it hves and moves, and they, perhaps, men whose legs are not of the \nstrongest, some of them fatahsts, gloomy, sick, some of them spoilt and artificial, \nsuch men as have an ambition to hide themselves. One thing they all have in \ncommon: they shut their ears to the raving stupidity and the noisy yapping of the \ndemocratic bourgeois. Indeed, it is a coarse and stupid France that trundles in the \nforeground today — it recently celebrated, at Victor Hugo's funeral, a veritable orgy \nof tastelessness and at the same time self-admiration. Something else too they have \nin common: a great will to resist spiritual Germanization — and an even greater \ninabihty to do so! Perhaps Schopenhauer has now become more at home and \nindigenous in this France of the spirit, which is also a France of pessimism, than he \never was in Germany; not to speak of Heinrich Heine, who has long since entered \ninto the flesh and blood of the more refined and demanding lyric poets of Paris, or \nof Hegel, who today, in the shape of Taine — that is to say, in that of the first of \nhving historians — exercises an almost tyrannical influence. As for Richard Wagner, \nhowever: the more French music leams to shape itself according to the actual needs \nof the âme modeme, the more will it “‘Wagnerize’, that one can safely predict — it is \ndoing so sufficiently already! There are nevertheless three things which, despite all \nvoluntary and involuntary Germanization and vulgarization of taste, the French can \nstill today exhibit with pride as their inheritance and possession and as an indehble \nmark of their ancient cultural superiority in Europe. Firstly, the capacity for artisti\npassions, for devotion to ‘form’, for which, together with a thousand others, the term \nl'art pour l'art has been devised — it has been present in France for three hundred \nyears and, thanks to their respect for the ‘small number’, has again and again made \npossible a kind of hterary chamber music not to be found anywhere else in Europe \n—. The second thing by which the French can argue their superiority to the rest of \nEurope is their ancient, manifold, morahstic culture, by virtue of which one finds on \naverage even in httle romanciers of the newspapers and chance boulevardiers de \nParis a psychological sensitivity and curiosity of which in Germany, for example, \nthey have no conception (not to speak of having the thing itself!). The Germans \nlack the couple of centuries of morahstic labour needed for this, a labour which, as \naforesaid, France did not spare itself; he who calls the Germans ‘naive’ on that \naccount commends them for a fault. (As antithesis to German inexperience and \ninnocence in voluptate psychologica, which is not too distantly related to the \nboringness of German company - and as the most successful expression of a \ngenuine French curiosity and inventiveness in this domain of dehcate thrills, one \nshould observe Henri Beyle, that remarkable anticipator and forerunner who ran \nwith a Napoleonic tempo through his Europe, through several centuries of the \nEuropean soul, as a detector and discoverer of his soul — it needed two generations \nto overtake him, to divine once more some of the riddles which tormented and \ndehghted him, this strange Epicurean and question-mark who was France's last \ngreat psychologist —.) There is yet a third claim to superiority: in the French nature \nthere exists a half-achieved synthesis of north and south which makes them \nunderstand many things and urges them to do many things which an Enghshman \nwill never understand. Their temperament, periodically tuming towards the south \nand away from the south, in which the Provengal and Ligurian blood from time to \ntime foams over, preserves them from dreary northem grey-on-grey and sunless \nconcept-ghouhshness and anaemia — the disease of our German taste against whose \nexcess one has at just this moment very resolutely prescribed blood and iron, that is \n\n\nto say ‘grand pohtics’ (in accordance with a dangerous therapeutic which has \ncertainly taught me how to wait but has not yet taught me how to hope —). Even now \nthere exists in France an understanding in advance and welcome for those rarer and \nrarely contented men who are too comprehensive to find their satisfaction in any \nkind of patriotism and know how to love the south in the north and the north in the \nsouth — for the bom Midlanders, the ‘good Europeans’. — It was for them that Bizet \nmade music, that last genius to perceive a new beauty and a new seduction — who \nhas discovered a region of the south in music."

Such a southemer, not b\ndescent but by faith, must, if he dreams of the future of music, also dream of the \nredemption of music from the north and have in his ears the prelude to a deeper, \nmightier, perhaps wickeder and more mysterious music, a supra-German music \nwhich does not fade, tum yellow, tum pale at the sight of the blue voluptuous sea \nand the luminous sky of the Mediterranean, as all German music does; a supraEuropean music which holds its own even before the brown sunsets of the desert, \nwhose soul is kindred to the palm-tree and knows how to roam and be at home \namong great beautiful sohtary beasts of prey....

In all the more profound and comprehensive men of this \n\n\ncentury the general tendency of the mysterious workings of their souls has really \nbeen to prepare the way to this new synthesis and to anticipate experimentally the \nEuropean of the future: only in their foregrounds, or in hours of weakness, in old \nage perhaps, were they among the ‘men of the fatherland’ — they were only taking a \nrest from themselves when they became ‘patriots’. I think of men such as Napoleon, \nGoethe, Beethoven, Stendhal, Heinrich Heine, Schopenhauer; I must not be blamed \nif I also include Richard Wagner among them: one should not let oneself be misled \nabout him by his own misunderstandings — geniuses of his sort seldom have the \nright to understand themselves — and even less, to be sure, by the unseemly noise \nwith which he is opposed and resisted today in France: the fact none the less \nremains that French late romanticism of the forties and Richard Wagner belong \nmost closely and intimately together. They are related, fundamentally related, in all \nthe heights and depths of their needs: it is Europe, the one Europe, whose soul \nforces its way longingly up and out through their manifold and impetuous art — \nwhither? into a new hght? towards a new sun? But who could express precisely what \nall these masters of new means of speech themselves did not know how to express \nclearly? What is certain is that they were tormented by the same storm and stress, \nthat they sought in the same way, these last great seekers! One and all dominated by \nhterature up to their eyes and ears — the first artists formed and cultivated by world\nhterature — most of them even writers and poets themselves and mediators and \nminglers of the arts and senses (as a musician Wagner belongs among painters, as a \npoet among musicians, as an artist as such among actors); one and all fanatics for \nexpression ‘at any cost — I call particular attention to Delacroix, Wagner's closest \nrelation — one and all great discoverers in the realm of the subhme, also of the ugly \nand horrible, even greater discoverers in effects, in display, in the art of the shop \nwindow, one and all talents far beyond their genius — virtuosos through and through, \nwith uncanny access to everything that seduces, lures, constrains, overwhelms, bom \nenemies of logic and straight hnes, constantly hankering after the strange, the \nexotic, the monstrous, the crooked, the self-contradictory; as human beings \nTantaluses of the will, plebeians risen in the world who knew themselves incapable, \nin their hves and in their works, of a noble tempo, a lento — think of Balzac, for \ninstance — unbridled workers, almost destroying themselves through work; \nantinomians, fomenters of moral disorder, ambitious, insatiable men without \nbalance or enjoyment; one and all collapsing and sinking at last before the Christian \nCross (and with every right: for who among them would have been profound or \nprimary enough for a philosophy of anti-Christ?) — on the whole an audaciousdaring, splendidly violent, high-flying type of higher men who bore others up with \nthem and whose lot it was to teach their century — and it is the century of the mob! \n— the concept ‘higher man’.... Let the German friends of Richard Wagner dehberate \nwhether there is in Wagnerian art anything simply German, or whether it is not \nprecisely its distinction that it derives from supra-German sources and impulses: in \nconsidering which it should not be underestimated how indispensable Paris was for \nthe cultivation of his type, how the depth of his instinct drew him precisely thither \nat the most decisive time, and how his whole manner of appearance and selfapostolate could perfect itself only by his seeing its French sociahst model. Perhaps \na subtler comparison will reveal that, to the credit of Richard Wagner's German \nnature, he fashioned stronger, more daring, more severe and more elevated things \nthan a nineteenth-century Frenchman could have done — thanks to the circumstance \n\n\nthat we Germans are still closer to barbarism than the French —; perhaps the most \nremarkable thing Wagner created is even inaccessible, inimitable to the entire, so \nlate Latin race for ever and not only for the present: the figure of Siegfried, that \nvery free human being who may indeed be much too free, too hard, too cheerful, \ntoo healthy, too anti-Cathohc for the taste of peoples of an ancient, mellow culture. \nHe may even have been a sin against romanticism, this anti-Romantic Siegfried: \nwell, Wagner amply atoned for this sin in his old, melancholy days when — \nanticipating a taste which has since become pohtical — he began, with the rehgious \nvehemence characteristic of him, if not to walk at any rate to preach the road to \nRome. — That these last words shall not be misunderstood I shall call to my aid a \nfew powerful rhymes which will reveal what I mean to less refined ears too — what I \nobject to in ‘late Wagner’ and his Parsifal music: \n— Is this still German? — \nFrom German heart this sultry ululating? \nOf German body this self-lacerating? \nGerman, this altar-priest prostration, \nThis incense-perfumed stimulation? \nGerman this reehng, stumbhng, tumbhng, \nThis muddy booming bim-bam-bumbhng, \nThis nunnish oghng, Ave-hour-bell chiming, \nThis false-ecstatic higher-than-heaven chmbing? \n— Is this still German? — \nReflect!

      "text": "In a tour of the many finer and coarser morahties which have ruled or still rule on \nearth I found certain traits regularly recurring together and bound up with one \nanother: until at length two basic types were revealed and a basic distinction \nemerged. There is master morahty and slave morahty — I add at once that in all \nhigher and mixed cultures attempts at mediation between the two are apparent and \nmore frequently confusion and mutual misunderstanding between them, indeed \nsometimes their harsh juxtaposition — even within the same man, within one soul. \nThe moral value-distinctions have arisen either among a ruhng order which was \npleasurably conscious of its distinction from the ruled — or among the ruled, the \nslaves and dependants of every degree. In the former case, when it is the rulers who \ndetermine the concept ‘good’, it is the exalted, proud states of soul which are \nconsidered distinguishing and determine the order of rank. The noble human being \nseparates from himself those natures in which the opposite of such exalted proud \nstates find expression: he despises them. It should be noted at once that in this first\ntype of morahty the antithesis ‘good’ and ‘bad’ means the same thing as ‘noble’ and \n‘despicable’ — the antithesis ‘good’ and ‘evil originates elsewhere. The cowardly, the \n\n\ntimid, the petty, and those who think only of narrow utihty are despised; as are the \nmistrustful with their constricted glance, those who abase themselves, the dog-hke \ntype of man who lets himself be mistreated, the fawning flatterer, above all the har \n— it is a fundamental behef of all aristocrats that the common people are hars. “We \nwho are truthful’ — thus did the nobihty of ancient Greece designate themselves. It \nis immediately obvious that designations of moral value were everywhere first \napphed to human beings, and only later and derivatively to actions: which is why it \nis a grave error when moral historians start from such questions as ‘why has the \ncompassionate action been praised?’ The noble type of man feels himself to be the \ndeterminer of values, he does not need to be approved of, he judges ‘what harms \nme is harmful in itself’, he knows himself to be that which in general first accords \nhonour to things, he creates values. Everything he knows to be part of himself, he \nhonours: such a morahty is self-glorification. In the foreground stands the feehng of\nplenitude, of power which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the \nconsciousness of a wealth which would hke to give away and bestow — the noble \nhuman being too aids the unfortunate but not, or almost not, from pity, but more \nfrom an urge begotten by superfluity of power. The noble human being honours in \nhimself the man of power, also the man who has power over himself, who \nunderstands how to speak and how to keep silent, who enjoys practising severity and \nharshness upon himself and feels reverence for all that is severe and harsh. ‘A hard \nheart has Wotan set in my breast’, it says in an old Scandinavian saga: a just \nexpression coming from the soul of a proud Viking. A man of this type is actually \nproud that he is not made for pity: which is why the hero of the saga adds as a \nwaming: ‘he whose heart is not hard in youth will never have a hard heart’. Brave \nand noble men who think that are at the farthest remove from that morahty which \nsees the mark of the moral precisely in pity or in acting for others or in \ndésintéressement; behef in oneself, pride in oneself, a fundamental hostihty and \nirony for ‘selflessness’ belong just as definitely to noble morahty as does a mild \ncontempt for and caution against sympathy and the ‘warm heart’. — It is the \npowerful who understand how to honour, that is their art, their realm of invention. \nDeep reverence for age and the traditional — all law rests on this twofold reverence — \nbehef in and prejudice in favour of ancestors and against descendants, is typical of \nthe morahty of the powerful; and when, conversely, men of ‘modem ideas’ beheve \nalmost instinctively in ‘progress’ and ‘the future’ and show an increasing lack of \nrespect for age, this reveals clearly enough the ignoble origin of these ‘ideas’. A \nmorahty of the rulers is, however, most ahen and painful to contemporary taste in \nthe severity of its principle that one has duties only towards one's equals; that \ntowards beings of a lower rank, towards everything ahen, one may act as one wishes \nor ‘as the heart dictates’ and in any case ‘beyond good and evil- : it is here that pit\nand the hke can have a place. The capacity for and the duty of protracted gratitude \nand protracted revenge — both only among one's equals — subtlety in requittal, a \nrefined conception of friendship, a certain need to have enemies (as conduit \nsystems, as it were, for the emotions of envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogance — \nfundamentally so as to be able to be a good friend): all these are typical marks of \nnoble morahty which, as previously indicated, is not the morahty of ‘modem ideas’ \nand is therefore hard to enter into today, also hard to unearth and uncover. — It is \notherwise with the second type of morahty, slave morahty. Suppose the abused, \noppressed, suffering, unfree, those uncertain of themselves and weary should \n\n\nmorahze: what would their moral evaluations have in common? Probably a \npessimistic mistrust of the entire situation of man will find expression, perhaps a \ncondemnation of man together with his situation. The slave is suspicious of the \nvirtues of the powerful: he is sceptical and mistrustful, keenly mistrustful, of \neverything ‘good’ that is honoured among them — he would hke to convince himself \nthat happiness itself is not genuine among them. On the other hand, those quahties \nwhich serve to make easier the existence of the suffering will be brought into \nprominence and flooded with hght: here it is that pity, the kind and helping hand, \nthe warm heart, patience, industriousness, humihty, friendhness come into honour — \nfor here these are the most useful quahties and virtually the only means of enduring \nthe burden of existence. Slave morahty is essentially the morahty of utihty. Here is\nthe source of the famous antithesis ‘good’ and ‘evil’ — power and danger were felt to \nexist in evil, a certain dreadfulness, subtlety and strength which could not admit of \ncontempt. Thus, according to slave morahty the ‘evil’ inspire fear; according to \nmaster morahty it is precisely the ‘good’ who inspire fear and want to inspire it, \nwhile the ‘bad’ man is judged contemptible. The antithesis reaches its height when, \nconsistently with slave morahty, a breath of disdain finally also comes to be \nattached to the ‘good’ of this morahty — it may be a shght and benevolent disdain — \nbecause within the slaves' way of thinking the good man has in any event to be a \nharmless man: he is good-natured, easy to deceive, perhaps a bit stupid, un \nbonhomme. Wherever slave morahty comes to predominate, language exhibits a \ntendency to bring the words ‘good’ and ‘stupid’ closer to each other. — A final \nfundamental distinction: the longing for freedom, the instinct for the happiness and \nthe refinements of the feehng of freedom, belong just as necessarily to slave \nmorahty and morals as the art of reverence and devotion and the enthusiasm for \nthem are the regular symptom of an aristocratic mode of thinking and valuating. — \nThis makes it clear without further ado why love as passion — it is our European \nspeciahty — absolutely must be of aristocratic origin: it was, as is well known, \ninvented by the poet-knights of Provence, those splendid, inventive men of the ‘gai \nsaber to whom Europe owes so much and, indeed, almost itself. —"

For him the problem is to imagine creatures \nwho try to awaken a good opinion of themselves which they themselves do not hold \n— and thus do not ‘deserve’ either — and yet subsequently come to beheve this good \nopinion themselves. This seems to him in part so tasteless and lacking in selfrespect and in part so baroquely irrational that he would prefer to consider vanity \nexceptional and in most cases where it is spoken of he doubts its existence. He will \nsay, for example: ‘I can rate my value incorrectly and yet demand that others too \nshould recognize my value exactly as I rate it — but that is not vanity (but selfconceit, or, more usually, what is called “humihty” or “modesty”).’ Or he will say: ‘I\n\n\ncan, for many reasons, take pleasure in the good opinion of others, perhaps because \nI love and honour them and take pleasure in all their pleasures, perhaps because \ntheir good opinion sustains me in my faith in my own good opinion, perhaps \nbecause the good opinion of others, even when I do not share it, is still useful to me \nor promises to be useful — but none of this is vanity.’ The noble human being \nrequires the assistance of history if he is to see that, from time immemorial, in all \nstrata which were in any way dependent the common man was only that which he \ncounted as — in no way accustomed to positing values himself, he also accorded \nhimself no other value than that which his master accorded him (it is the intrinsic \nright of masters to create values). It can be conceived as the consequence of a \ntremendous atavism that even now the ordinary man still always waits for an opinion \nabout himself and then instinctively submits to it: but this happens not merely in the \ncase of a ‘good’ opinion, but also in that of a bad and unfair one (consider, for \ninstance, the greater part of the self-estimates and self-underestimates which \nbeheving women acquire from their father-confessors and the beheving Christian \nacquires from his Church). Now it is a fact that, in accordance with the slow rise of \nthe democratic order of things (and its cause, the mixing of the blood of masters \nand slaves), the originally noble and rare impulse to ascribe a value to oneself on \none's own account and to ‘think well’ of oneself will be increasingly encouraged and \nspread wider and wider: but it has at all times an older, more widespread and more \nthoroughly ingrained inchnation against it — and in the phenomenon of ‘vanity’ this \nolder inchnation masters the younger. The vain man takes pleasure in every good \nopinion he hears about himself (quite apart from any point of view of utihty and \nhkewise regardless of truth or falsehood), just as he suffers from every bad opinion: \nfor he submits to both, he feels subject to them from that oldest instinct of \nsubjection which breaks out in him. — It is ‘the slave’ in the vain man's blood, a \nremnant of the craftiness of the slave — and how much ‘slave’ still remains in \nwoman, for example! — which seeks to seduce him to good opinions about himself; \nit is hkewise the slave who immediately afterwards falls down before these opinions \nas if he himself had not called them forth. — And to say it again: vanity is an \natavism."

In the end, however, there arises one \nday an easier state of affairs and the tremendous tension relaxes; perhaps there are \nno longer any enemies among their neighbours, and the means of hfe, even for the \nenjoyment of hfe, are there in plenty. With one stroke the bond and constraint of \nthe ancient disciphne is broken: it is no longer felt to be a necessity, a condition o\nexistence — if it were to persist it could be only as a form of luxury, as an archaizin\ntaste. Variation, whether as deviation (into the higher, rarer, more refined) or as \ndegeneration and monstrosity, is suddenly on the scene in the greatest splendour and \nabundance, the individual dares to be individual and stand out. At these tumingpoints of history there appear side by side and often entangled and entwined \ntogether a glorious, manifold, junglehke growth and up-stirring, a kind of tropical \ntempo in competition in growing, and a tremendous perishing and self-destruction, \nthanks to the savage egoisms which, tuming on one another and as it were \nexploding, wrestle together ‘for sun and hght’ and no longer know how to draw any \nhmitation, any restraint, any forbearance from the morahty reigning hitherto. It was \nthis morahty which stored up such enormous energy, which bent the bow in such a \nthreatening manner — now it is ‘spent’, now it is becoming ‘outhved’. The dangerous \nand uncanny point is reached where the grander, more manifold, more \ncomprehensive hfe hves beyond the old morahty; the ‘individual’ stands there, \nreduced to his own law-giving, to his own arts and stratagems for self-preservation, \nself-enhancement, self-redemption. Nothing but new whys and wherewithalls, no \nlonger any common formulas, misunderstanding in alhance with disrespect, decay, \ncorruption and the highest desires horribly tangled together, the genius of the race \noverflowing out of every comucopia of good and bad, spring and autumn falhng \nfatally together, full of novel charms and veils such as pertain to youthful, still \nunexhausted, still unwearied corruption. Danger is again present, the mother of \nmorahty, great danger, only this time it comes from the individual, from neighbour \nand friend, from the street, from one's own child, from one's own heart, from the \nmost personal and secret recesses of wish and will: what will the moral philosophers \nwho come up in this age now have to preach? They discover, these acute observers \nand idlers, that the end is fast approaching, that everything around them is corrupt \nand corrupting, that nothing can last beyond the day after tomorrow, one species of \nman excepted, the incurably mediocre. The mediocre alone have the prospect of \ncontinuing on and propagating themselves — they are the men of the future, the sole \nsurvivors; ‘be hke them! become mediocre!’ is henceforth the only morahty that has \nany meaning left, that still finds ears to hear it. — But it is difficult to preach, th\nmorahty of mediocrity! — for it can never admit what it is and what it wants! it has \n\n\nto speak of moderation and dignity and duty and love of one's neighbour — it will \nscarcely be able to conceal its irony! —"

The refinement, goodness and loftiness of a soul is put to a \nperilous test whenever something passes before it that is of the first rank but not yet\nprotected from importunate clumsiness and claws by the awe of authority: \nsomething that goes its way unsignahzed, undiscovered, tempting, perhaps \narbitrarily obscured and disguised, hke a hving touchstone. He whose task and \npractice it is to explore the soul will avail himself of precisely this art in many \nforms in order to determine the ultimate value of a soul, the unalterable innate \norder of rank to which it belongs: he will test it for its instinct of reverence. \nDifférence engendre haine: the commonness of some natures suddenly spurts up hke \ndirty water whenever some sacred vessel, some precious object from a closed \nshrine, some book with the marks of a great destiny is carried by; and on the other \nhand there is an involuntary falhng silent, a hesitation of the eye, a cessation of al\ngestures, which reveal that a soul feels the proximity of something most worthy of \nrespect. The way in which reverence for the Bible has hitherto been generally \nmaintained in Europe is perhaps the best piece of disciphne and refinement of \nmanners that Europe owes to Christianity: such books of profundity and ultimate \nsignificance require for their protection an extemal tyranny of authority, in order \nthat they may achieve those millennia of continued existence which are needed if \nthey are to be exhausted and unriddled.

Conversely, there is perhaps \nnothing about the so-called cultured, the behevers in ‘modem ideas’, that arouses so \nmuch disgust as their lack of shame, the self-satisfied insolence of eye and hand \nwith which they touch, hck and fumble with everything; and it is possible that more \nrelative nobihty of taste and reverential tact is to be discovered today among the \npeople, among the lower orders and especially among peasants, than among the \nnewspaper-reading demi-monde of the spirit, the cultured."

To understand one another it is not \nsufficient to employ the same words; we have also to employ the same words to \ndesignate the same species of inner experiences, we must ultimately have our \nexperience in common. That is why the members of one people understand one \nanother better than do members of differing peoples even when they use the same \nlanguage; or rather, when human beings have hved together for a long time under \nsimilar conditions (of chmate, soil, danger, needs, work), there arises from this a \ngroup who ‘understand one another’, a people. In every soul in this group an \nequivalent number of frequently recurring experiences has gained the upper hand \nover those which come more rarely: it is on the basis of these that people \nunderstand one another, quickly and ever more quickly — the history of language is \nthe history of a process of abbreviation —; it is on the basis of this quick \nunderstanding that they unite together, closely and ever more closely. The greater \nthe danger, the greater is the need to reach agreement quickly and easily as to what \nhas to be done; not to misunderstand one another in situations of danger is an \nabsolute necessity in human relations. One makes this same test even in the case of \nfriendships or love-affairs: nothing of that sort can last once it is discovered that \nwhen one party uses words he connects them with feehngs, intentions, perceptions, \ndesires, fears different from those the other party connects them with. (Fear of the \n‘etemal misunderstanding’: that is the benevolent genius who so often keeps persons \nof differing sex from over-hasty attachments to which senses and heart prompt \nthem — and not some Schopenhaueran ‘genius of the species’ — !) Exactly which \ngroups of sensations are awakened, begin to speak, issue commands most quickly \nwithin a soul, is decisive for the whole order of rank of its values and ultimately \ndetermines its table of desiderata. A human being's evaluations betray something of \n\n\nthe structure of his soul and where it sees its conditions of hfe, its real needs. Now\nsupposing that need has at all times brought together only such human beings as \ncould indicate similar requirements, similar experiences by means of similar signs, \nit follows that on the whole the easy communicabihty of need, that is to say \nultimately the experiencing of only average and common experiences, must have \nbeen the most powerful of all the powerful forces which have disposed of mankind \nhitherto. The more similar, more ordinary human beings have had and still have the \nadvantage, the more select, subtle, rare and harder to understand are hable to \nremain alone, succumb to accidents in their isolation and seldom propagate \nthemselves. Tremendous counter-forces have to be called upon to cross this natural, \nall too natural progressus in simile, the continuing development of mankind into the \nsimilar, ordinary, average, herdhke — into the common!"

For the corruption, the ruination of higher human beings, of more \nstrangely constituted souls, is the rule: it is dreadful to have such a rule always \nbefore one's eyes. The manifold torment of the psychologist who has discovered this \nruination, who discovers this whole inner ‘wretchedness’ of the higher human being, \nthis etemal ‘too late!’ in every sense, first once and then almost always throughout \nthe whole of history — may perhaps one day make him tum against his whole lot \nand drive him to attempt selfdestruction — to his own ‘ruination’. One will perceive \nin almost every psychologist a telltale preference for and pleasure in associating \nwith everyday and well-ordered people: this betrays that he is in constant need of a \ncure, that he requires a kind of fhght and forgetting, away from that which his \ninsights and incisions, his ‘trade’, has laid upon his conscience. It is characteristic\nhim that he is afraid of his memory. He is easily silenced by the judgement of \nothers: he hstens with a straight face when people venerate, admire, love, transfigure\nwhere he has seen — or he conceals even his silence by expressly agreeing with some \nsuperficial opinion. Perhaps the paradox of his situation is so ghastly that precisely \nwhere he has leamed great pity together with great contempt the mob, the cultured, \nthe enthusiasts leam great veneration — veneration for “great men’ and prodigies on \nwhose account they bless the fatherland, the earth, the dignity of mankind and \nthemselves, in whose direction they point the young and on whose model they \neducate them.... And who knows whether what has happened hitherto in all great \ncases has not always been the same thing: that the mob worshipped a god — and that \nthe ‘god’ was only a poor sacrificial beast! Success has always been the biggest har —\nand the ‘work’ itself a kind of success; the great statesman, the conqueror, the \ndiscoverer is disguised by his creations to the point of unrecognizabihty: the ‘work’,\nthat of the artist or the philosopher, invents him who created it, is supposed to have \ncreated it; ‘great men’, as they are venerated, are bad httle fictions invented \nafterwards; in the world of historical values false coinage is the rule. Great poets, f\nexample, such as Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi, Kleist, Gogol (I do not dare to \n\n\nname greater names, but I mean them) — as they are and perhaps have to be: men of \nmoments, enthusiastic, sensual, childish, sudden and frivolous in trust and mistrust; \nwith souls in which some fracture is usually trying to hide; often taking revenge \nwith their works for an inner defilement, often seeking with their exaggerations \nforgetfulness of an all too faithful memory, often lost in the mud and almost in love \nwith it, until they become hke will-o’-the-wisps around swamps and pretend to be \nstars — the people may then call them ideahsts — often strugghng against a \nprotracted disgust, a recurring spectre of unbehef which freezes them and compels \nthem to languish for gloria and to devour ‘behef in themselves’ out of the hands of \nintoxicated adulators — what a torment these great artists and higher human beings \nin general are for him who has once divined what they are! It is so very \nunderstandable that they should so easily receive precisely from woman — who is \nclairvoyante in the world of suffering and unfortunately also eager to help and save \nfar beyond her power to do so — those outbursts of boundless, most devoted pity \nwhich the mob, above all the venerating mob, fails to understand and loads with \ninquisitive and self-satisfied interpretations. This pity habitually deceives itself \nabout its strength; woman would hke to beheve that love can do everything — it is \nher characteristic faith. Alas, he who knows the heart divines how poor, stupid, \nhelpless, arrogant, blundering, more prone to destroy than save is even the best and \ndeepest love! — It is possible that within the holy disguise and fable of Jesus' hfe \nthere hes concealed one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of knowledge \nabout love: the martyrdom of the most innocent and longing heart which never had \nsufficient of human love, which demanded love, to be loved and nothing else, \ndemanded it with hardness, with madness, with fearful outbursts against those who \ndenied it love; the story of a poor soul unsated and insatiable in love who had to \ninvent hell so as to send there those who did not want to love him — and who, \nhaving become knowledgeable about human love, finally had to invent a god who is \nwholly love, wholly abihty to love — who has mercy on human love because it is so \nvery paltry and ignorant!

What, beneath this \nheavy, overcast sky of the beginning rule of the rabble which makes everything \nleaden and opaque, betrays and makes evident the noble human being? — It is not \nhis actions which reveal him — actions are always ambiguous, always \nunfathomable-; neither is it his ‘works’. One finds today among artists and scholars \nsufficient who reveal by their works that they are driven on by a profound desire for \nthe noble: but precisely this need for the noble is fundamentally different from the \nneeds of the noble soul itself, and in fact an eloquent and dangerous sign of its lack.\nIt is not the works, it is the faith which is decisive here, which determines the order\nof rank here, to employ an old rehgious formula in a new and deeper sense: some \nfundamental certainty which a noble soul possesses in regard to itself, something \nwhich may not be sought or found and perhaps may not be lost either. — The noble \nsoul has reverence for itself. —"

One of the subtlest ways of deceiving, for as long as possible \nat any rate, and of successfully posing as more stupid than one is — which in \neveryday hfe is often as desirable as an umbrella — is called enthusiasm: plus what \nbelongs with it, for example virtue.

He who has sat alone with his soul day and night, year in year out, in \nconfidential discord and discourse, and in his cave — it may be a labyrinth, but it \nmay be a goldmine — become a cave-bear or treasure-hunter or a treasure-guardian \nand dragon, finds that his concepts themselves at last acquire a characteristic \ntwihght colour, a smell of the depths and of must, something incommunicable and \nreluctant which blows cold on every passer-by. The hermit does not beheve that a \nphilosopher — supposing that a philosopher has always been first of all a hermit — \nhas ever expressed his real and final opinions in books: does one not write books \nprecisely to conceal what hes within us? — indeed, he will doubt whether a \nphilosopher could have ‘final and real’ opinions at all, whether behind each of his \ncaves there does not and must not he another, deeper cave — a stranger, more \ncomprehensive world beyond the surface, an abyss behind every ground, beneath \nevery ‘foundation’. Every philosophy is a foreground philosophy — that is a hermit's \njudgement: ‘there is something arbitrary in the fact that he stopped, looked back, \nlooked around here, that he stopped digging and laid his spade aside here — there is \nalso something suspicious about it.’ Every philosophy also conceals a philosophy; \nevery opinion is also a hiding-place, every word also a mask."

Of whom am I speaking to you? Have I \nso far forgot myself that I have not even told you his name? Unless you have already \nyourselves divined who this questionable god and spirit is who wants to be praised \nin such a fashion. For as happens to everyone who has always been on the move and \nin foreign lands from his childhood up, so many a strange and not undangerous \nspirit has crossed my path too, but above all he of whom I was just speaking, and he \nagain and again, no less a personage in fact than the god Dionysus, that great \nambiguous and tempter god to whom, as you know, once I brought in all secrecy \nand reverence my first-bom — being, as it seems to me, the last to have brought him \na sacrifice: for I have found no one who could have understood what I was then \ndoing. Meanwhile, I have leamed much, all too much more about the philosophy of \nthis god and, as I have said, from mouth to mouth — I, the last disciple and initiate \nof the god Dionysus: and perhaps I might at last begin to give you, my friends, a \nhttle taste of this philosophy, in so far as I am permitted to? In a hushed voice, as \nonly proper: for it involves much that is secret, new, unfamihar, strange, uncanny. \nThe very fact that Dionysus is a philosopher, and that gods too therefore \nphilosophize, seems a by no means harmless novelty and one calculated to excite \nsuspicion precisely among philosophers — among you, my friends, it will meet with \na friendher reception, unless it comes too late and not at the right time: for, as I \nhave discovered, you no longer hke to beheve in God and gods now. Perhaps I shall \nalso have to go further in the frankness of my story than may always be agreeable to \nthe strict habits of your ears? Certainly the above-named god went further, very \nmuch further, in conversations of this sort, and was always many steps ahead of \nme.... Indeed, if it were permitted to follow the human custom of applying to him \nbeautiful, solemn titles of pomp and virtue, I would have to extol his courage as \ninvestigator and discoverer, his daring honesty, truthfulness and love of wisdom. \nBut such a god has nothing to do with all this venerable lumber and pomp. ‘Keep \nthat,’ he would say, ‘for yourself and your hke and for anyone else who needs it! I — \nhave no reason to cover my nakedness!’ — One will see that this species of divinity \nand philosopher is perhaps lacking in shame? — Thus he once said: ‘Under certain \ncircumstances I love mankind’ — alluding to Ariadne, who was present — : ‘Man is to \nme an agreeable, brave, ingenious animal without equal on earth, he knows how to \nmake his way through every labyrinth. I hke him: I often ponder how I might \nadvance him and make him stronger, more evil and more profound than he is.’ — \n‘Stronger, more evil and more profound?’ I asked in alarm. ‘Yes, he repeated, \n‘stronger, more evil and more profound; also more beautiful’ — and as he said that \n\n\nthe tempter god smiled his halcyon smile, as though he had just paid a charming \ncomphment. Here one will also see that this divinity is lacking not only in shame — ; \nand there is in general good reason to suppose that in several respects the gods \ncould all benefit from instruction by us human beings.

More generally, \na way of thinking based upon principles which have not been tested by reflection’. \nVedanta: the Veda is the body of Hindu scripture, the Vedanta the rehgious and \nphilosophical teaching derived from it. \n\n\ngood Europeans: a coinage of Nietzsche's, probably as an antithesis to ‘good \nGerman’ (first used in Human, All Too Human 475). \nfree spirits: freien Geister. ‘Geister’ is the plural of ‘Geist’, a word whose meaning \nand overtones cannot be fully transmitted in a single Enghsh word: it means mind, \nintellect, the intelhgence, the thinking faculty, the ‘spirit’ as opposed to the ‘body\n(and thus, in the right context, ‘ghost’), and broadly speaking everything contained \nin the concept ‘the human spirit’. In the present translation I have consistently \nrendered Geist as ‘spirit’, but the reader should remember that the word as used in \nGerman is strongly biased towards equating ‘spirit’ and ‘mind’, so that the idea of \nintelhgence is bound up with it. A ‘free spirit’ is thus something comparable with a \n‘free-thinker’, although Nietzsche very strongly repudiates any equating of the two \n(see Section 44). \ntarget: the primary meaning of Ziel, the word used here, is “goal, aim, objective’, \nbut it is also used for a ‘target’ or ‘butt’; the primary meaning 1s, of course, intend\nbut the metaphor from archery prevents us from using it. \n2. de omnibus dubitandum: everything is to be doubted (Descartes). \nforeground valuations: Vordergrunds-Schatzungen. ‘Foreground’ a Nietzschean \nidiom meaning ‘surface, superficial’; balanced by ‘background’, meaning \n‘fundamental, real’. \n3. niaiserie: foohshness. man... the ‘measure of things’: a dictum of Protagoras: \n‘Man is the measure of things, of the things that are that they are, of the things that\nare not that they are not.’ \n4. synthetic judgements a priori: ‘jadgement’ is Kant's term for a proposition; a \nsynthetic judgement is a proposition whose predicate is not contained in its subject \nand the contrary of which is not a self-contradiction; an a priori judgement is a \nproposition which is independent of experience; a synthetic a priori judgement is a \nproposition whose contrary is not a selfcontradiction and which is independent of \nexperience. ‘Every event has a cause’ is a synthetic a priori judgement: synthetic \nbecause its predicate ‘cause’ is not contained in its subject ‘event’, a priori because\nis not verifiable by experience. Kant maintained that the propositions of \nmathematics, science and morahty are all synthetic a priori and his concem was to \ndiscover how they are possible. (For Nietzsche's criticism of his answer, see Section \n11.) \n5. categorical imperative’: ‘Act as if the maxim of your action were to become \nthrough your will a general natural law’ is one of the definitions of the ‘categorical \nimperative’ in Kant's Metaphysic of Morals. \nthe love of his wisdom’: ‘philosophy’ means ‘love of wisdom’. \n\n\n7. Nietzsche's respect for Epicurus was by 1886 in dechne, and he later called \nhim ‘a typical decadent’ (Anti-Christ 30), but in earher years he had held him in the \nhighest regard — see Human, All Too Human 68, Assorted Opinions and Maxims \n408, The Wanderer and his Shadow 7, 192, 227, 295, Dawn 72, The Gay Science \n45. \nDionysus: tyrant of Syracuse at whose court Plato spent some years. \n8. adventavit, etc.: the ass came along, beautiful and strong. \n9. causa prima: first cause (usually = God). \n11. table of categories: the concepts which are a priori Kant called ‘categories’. \nby means of a faculty: Vermöge eines Vermögens — the tautology is more evident \nin the original. \nniaiserie allemande: German foohshness. \nCollege of Tiibingen: a theological seminary in Swabia. \n‘finding’ and inventing”: ‘finden’ und ‘erfinden’. \nquia est in eo, etc.: because there is in it a sleep-inducing faculty whose property it\nis to make the senses drowsy. \ninverted commas: Gänsefüsschen, hterally ‘goose-feet’ \n12. the Pole Boscovich: Ruggiero Giuseppi Boscovich (1711-87), mathematician \nand physicist; actually a Croatian. \ninventing... finding: Erfinden... Finden. \n13. For his opposition to explanation in terms of purpose, see e.g. Dawn 130, Gay \nScience 360, Twihght of the Idols VI 8, Will to Power 260, 526, 552, 574, 602, 666, \n671; for his opposition to mechanistic explanations, see e.g. Section 21, and Will to \nPower 551, 617, 634, 635, 660, 689, 1066. \n15. Phenomena ‘in the sense of ideahst philosophy’ are the product of the mind \nwhich perceives them. \nreductio ad absurdum: reduction to the absurd. \ncausa sui: the cause of itself (usually = God). \n\n\n16. contradictio in adjecto: contradiction in terms (hterally a contradiction \nbetween the adjective and the noun it quahfies). \n19. L'effet, c'est moi: I am the effect. \n21. ‘la rehgion de la souffrance humaine’: the rehgion of human suffering. \n22. ‘Ni dieu, ni maitre’: neither God nor master. \n23. sacrifizio dell’ intelletto: sacrifice of the intellect. \n26. Abbé Gahani: Ferdinando Gahani (1728—87), Itahan writer and economist. \n27. gangasrotogati: correctly gangdsrotagati = as the Ganges flows (i.e. fast). \nkurmagat: correctly kirmagati = as the tortoise moves (i.e. slowly). mandeikagati: \ncorrectly mandikagati. (These corrections and definitions are taken from Walter \nKaufmann's edition of Beyond Good and Evil.) \n28. in moribus et artibus: in morals and arts. Bayle: Pierre Bayle (1647-1706), \nphilosopher, author of the Dictionnaire Historique et Critique (1692), one of the \nmost famous works of seventeenth-century philosophy. \npetit fait: httle fact. \n31. As a supplement to this acute piece of psychological analysis, compare On the \nUse and Disadvantage of History 10, Human, All Too Human 539, Assorted \nOpinions and Maxims 161, 285, 289. \n34. advocatus dei: God's advocate. \n35. “il ne cherche le vrai’, etc.: he seeks the true only so as to do the good. \n38. For more on the French Revolution, see e.g. Sections 46, 191, 239, 244, 245, \n258, and Human, All Too Human 463, Dawn 534, Gay Science 350, Genealogy of \nMorals I 16, Twihght IX 48, Anti-Christ 11, Will to Power 60, 90, 94, 184, 864, \n877. \n39. Pour être bon philosophe’, etc.: “To be a good philosopher it is necessary to be \ndry, clear, without illusion. A banker who has made a fortune has something of the \ncharacter needed for making discoveries in philosophy, that is to say for seeing \nclearly into that which is.’ \n42. attempters... attempt:... temptation: Versucher... Versuch... Versuchung. \n‘Versucher’ also means ‘experimenter’, ‘Versuch’ experiment. The point is that these \ncoming philosophers' will not be dogmatists. Compare Gay Science 51: “Give me \nany kind of sceptical proposal to which I am permitted to reply: “Let's try it! \n\n\n[ Versuchen wir's!|” But I want to hear nothing more of any thing or any question \nwhich does not permit of experimentation...’ The play upon Versuch and \nVersuchung is very frequent in Nietzsche's work. \n45. knowledge and conscience: Wissen und Gewissen. \nbomines rehgiosi: rehgious men. \n46. In 1888 Nietzsche planned a book to be called The Revaluation of All Values. \n(The Anti-Christ was originally intended as the first part of it.) His employment of \nthe identical phrase (Umwertung aller... Werte) to describe the effect of Christianity \non the ancient world illumines the nature of his own ‘revaluation’ and ‘antiChristianity’: what he proposed was not an inversion of values but the undoing of a \nprevious inversion. \nabsurdissimum: extreme of absurdity. \n47. In the phrase ‘the rehgious nature’ (das rehgiöse Wesen), ‘nature’ is not quite \nsatisfactory as a translation of ‘Wesen’, but I have used it because the phrase is also\nthe title of this Part of the book. ‘Weser is a word with many meanings: here the \nforeground meaning seems to be ‘ado’, ‘to-do’ — the ‘ado about rehgion’. \nKundry: the female character in Wagner's Parsifal. \ntype vécu: a type that has existed. \n48. Auguste Comte: French philosopher (1798—1857). Sainie Beuve: CharlesAugustin Sainte-Beuve (1804—69), French hterary critic and historian. \nEmest Renan: French rationahst (1823—92). \n‘Disons donc hardiment’, etc.: “Therefore let us venture to say that rehgion is a \nproduct of the normal man, that man is nearest to the truth when he is most \nrehgious and most assured of an etemal destiny... It is when he is good that he \nwants virtue to correspond to an etemal order, it is when he contemplates things in \na disinterested way that he finds death revolting and absurd. How can we not \nsuppose it is in these moments that man sees best?’ \n49. For another, much more detailed discussion of ‘what is noble in Greek \nrehgiosity’, see Human, All Too Human Il. \n50. Madame de Guyon: Jeanne-Marie Bouvier de la Motte-Guyon (1648-1717), \nFrench mystic and Quietist. \n\n\n51. Nietzsche's principal excursus on asceticism and the ascetic saint is in On the \nGenealogy of Morals III (a sixty-page essay called ‘What is the Meaning of Ascetic \nIdeals?’). \n52. Compare Dawn 84 and the Genealogy of Morals III 22. \n53. On atheism as a question of honesty, see Gay Science 357 and the Genealogy \nof Morals II 27. \n55. For more on cruelty, see Sections 229 and 230; and compare Human, All Too \nHuman 101, Dawn 18, Genealogy of Morals Il. \nda capo: again from the beginning — a reference to the etemal recurrence, for \nwhich see Gay Science 341 and Zarathustra III 2, 13, 15, 16, and IV 19. \n56. circulus vitiosus deus: a vicious circle as God, or God as a vicious circle. \n57. old man... ‘old man’: the first ‘man’ is Mann, the second Mensch, i.e. mankind, \nthe human race. \n59. Compare Human, All Too Human 4, which begins: ‘It is probable that the \nobjects of the rehgious, moral and aesthetic sensations belong... only to the surface \nof things...’ \n60. Compare Section 198, and Zarathustra I 16. \n61. On the conception of the philosopher as ‘the man of the most comprehensive \nresponsibihty who has the conscience for the collective evolution of mankind’, \ncompare Human, All Too Human 25: \nSince the behef that a God directs the fate of the world has disappeared... mankind it\nmust set up oecumenical goals embracing the entire earth... if mankind is not to destro\nthrough conscious possession of such universal rule, it must first of all attain to an \nunprecedented knowledge of the preconditions of culture as a scientific standard for \noecumenical goals. Herein hes the tremendous task facing the great spirits of the comi\ncentury. \n62. Compare Section 46 and the note to that section; and see also Twihght VII 2, \nand Anti-Christ 2-7. \n\n\n64. Section 344 of The Gay Science (in Book Five, added to the second edition of \n1887) is the best commentary on this aphorism. \n65a. In the original edition numbered 65, hke the section preceding it; the ‘a’ \nadded in the standard edition. (Similarly for Section 73a.) \n66. Compare Twihght IX 46. \n68. Describes a phenomenon now called, after Freud, ‘repression’. \n105. pia fraus: pious fraud. \n122 . pohteness of the heart: a phrase from Goethe's Elective Affinities (II 5): \n‘There is a pohteness of the heart; it is related to love. It gives rise to the most \ncomfortable pohteness of outward behaviour.’ \n142. Dans le véritable amour’, etc.: ‘In true love it is the soul which envelops the \nbody.’ \n147. buona femmina, etc.: good women and bad women need beating. Sacchetti: \nFranco Sacchetti (c. 1330—1400), Florentine poet and novehst. \n186. Fundamental Problems of Ethics: Schopenhauer's Die beiden Grundprobleme \nder Ethic (The Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics) was pubhshed in 1841. The \npassage quoted comes from ‘On the Basis of Morals’, the second of the two long \nessays of which the book consists. ‘Actually’ and ‘actual’ are emphasized by \nNietzsche, not in the original. \nneminem laede, etc: harm no one, rather help everyone as much as you are able. \n188. laisser aller: letting go. \n189. ‘Subhmated itself? is, in the original, ‘sich subhmierf . It is interesting that\nNietzsche should employ precisely the word ‘subhmieren’, instead of such synonyms \nof it as ‘selbst-aufheben’ or ‘selbst-iiberwinden’, which he employs in other contexts,\nwhen referring to the subhmation of sexuahty. For an example of his use of the \nphrase ‘subhmated (subhmierte) sexuahty’, see Assorted Opinions and Maxims 95. \n190. prosthe Platon, etc.: Plato in front, Plato behind, chimaera in the middle. The \nphrase is based on the description of the chimaera in the Miad: ‘Lion in front, \nserpent behind, goat in the middle’. \n191. On the relationship between instinct and reason in Socrates, see especially \nTwihght I. \n\n\n192. arcubahsta: crossbow. Armbrust: also crossbow — but the elements of which \nthe word is composed mean ‘arm’ and ‘breast’: “Armbrust? is clearly a mere imitation \nof sounds without regard to their meaning. \n193. Quidquid luce fuit, etc.: That which happens in the hght persists in the dark. \n195. The thesis of this section is greatly elaborated in the Genealogy of Morals I, \nTwihght VII and the Anti-Christ passim. For Nietzsche's opinions on ancient and \ncontemporary Jewry, see also Sections 248, 250 and 251, and Human 475, Dawn \n38, 205, 377, Gay Science 135, 136, 248, 361. \n197. For Nietzsche on Cesare Borgia, see also Twihght IX 37, Anti-Christ 46, 61, \nEcce Homo III 1, Will to Power 871, and his letter to Brandes of 20 November \n1888. \n198. Hafiz and Goethe: Hafiz (Mahommed Shams-ud-din, died 1389) is reputedly \nthe greatest Persian poet, compared with whom our own adopted Omar is a tinkhng \nbell, and this status-relationship is repeated in that between Goethe's Westosthcher \nDivan (inspired by Hafiz) and Fitzgerald's Rub‘aiy‘at. But the voice within the \ntavem was as clearly audible to Hafiz as it was to Omar, and he obeyed it just as \nreadily. (It is presumably the direct prohibition of alcohol in the Koran which made \nof these poets, not merely heavy drinkers, but vehement advocates of drunkenness.) \nGoethe was also, and even by the hberal standards of his age and class, a very heavy \ndrinker — but he could hold his drink and the suggestion (perhaps not wholly \nserious) that he was a drunkard derives from Nietzsche's own enforced \nabstemiousness. \nhcentia morum: moral hcence. \n199. For Nietzsche on Napoleon, see also Sections 244 and 256, and compare \nThe Birth of Tragedy 18, Human 164, Dawn 109, 245, 298, 549, The Gay Science \n23, 282, 362, the Genealogy I 16, Twihght IX 44, 45, 48, 49, Will to Power 27, 104, \n544, 751, 829, 877, 975, 1017, 1018, 1026. \n201. For further reflections on the role of fear in human culture and morahty, see \nSection 229, and Human 169, Wanderer and his Shadow 50, Dawn 26, 57, 104, \n142, 173, 174, 220, 241, 250, 309, 310, 538, 551, Gay Science 355, Genealogy Il \n19, Will to Power 576; and for a contrasting point of view, Zarathustra IV 15. \nres pubhca: commonwealth. \n\n\n202-3. These two sections are a restatement in more directly pohtical terms of \nthe assertions which find ‘poetic’ expression in Zarathustra: see especially I \nPrologue, II 7 and 18, III 5 and 12 (2). \n204. In this Part of the book ‘scholar’ and ‘man of science’ are used indifferently \nto mean the practitioners of the leamed professions as opposed to the philosopher \nin Nietzsche's conception of him. (See especially Sections 205, 206, 207 and 211.) \nmontrer ses plaies: display of one's wounds. \nmost cultured and conceited: gebildetsten und eingebildetsten. \notium: leisure. \nEugen Diihring (1833-1921), Eduard von Hartmann (1842-1906), German \nphilosophers. \n207. ipsissimosity: ‘very ownness’, from ipsissima = very own. \ncaput mortuum: dross. \n‘Je ne méprise presque rien’: | despise almost nothing. \nGewaltmensch: I leave this word in German because, hke a few other German \nsubstantives (e.g. Schadenfreude, Dehkatessen, Festschrift), it precisely designates \nsomething for which no single Enghsh word exists. “Gewalf means primarily the \npower to dominate other people, and is connected with walten = to rule, but it also \ncontains the idea of violence or brutahty. A “Gewaltmenscl’ is thus a ‘strong man’ \nwho dominates by violence; the usage of the word, however, has given it a definitely \nmedieval sound — so that its true Enghsh definition would be ‘a man hke Wilham \nthe Conqueror or Edward P. \n208. bonae voluntatis: of good will. \nl'art pour l'art. art for art's sake. \n209. ‘dogmatic slumber’: alludes to Kant's statement that Hume had awoken him \nfrom his ‘dogmatic slumber’. \n210. Chinaman of Konigsberg: Kant. \n211-13. For further examples of Nietzsche's conception of the philosopher, see \nSchopenhauer as Educator 3, 5,7, Gay Science Preface 3, 289, 343, 381, Genealogy \nI note, III 7, 8. \n218. bétise bourgeoise: bourgeois stupidity. \n‘homo bonae voluntatis’: man of good will. \n\n\n222. suffers... ‘suffer with his fellows’: leidet... ‘mit leidet’. Mitleiden = to pity \n(suffer with). \n223. Nietzsche's most extended critique of the nineteenth century's \nunprecedented sense of and preoccupation with history is his essay On the Use and \nDisadvantage of History for Life. \n224. For further remarks on Homer, see Homer and Classical Philology (1869), \n‘Homer's Contest’ (Five Prefaces to Five Unwritten Books, 1872), Birth of Tragedy \n3,5, Human 45, 125, 159, 211, 262, Assorted Opinions and Maxims 189, 212, 219, \n220, Wanderer and his Shadow 113, 140, Gay Science 302, Genealogy III 4, 25; and \non Shakespeare, Birth of Tragedy 7 (Hamlet), Richard Wagner in Bayreuth 3, \nHuman 61 (Othello), 125, 162, 176, 221, Assorted Opinions 162, Dawn 76, 240 \n(Macbeth), 549, Gay Science 98 (Juhus Caesar), 167 (Hamlet), Ecce Homo II 4, \nWill to Power 848, 996. \n227. ‘nitimur in vetitum’: we strive after the forbidden (Ovid). \n228. Helvétius: Claude Adrien Helvétius (1715-71), encyclopedist, atheist, \nmateriahst. \nce senateur Pococurante: ‘pococurante’ means easy-going. \ncomfort... fashion: in Enghsh in the original. \n229. ‘milk of pious thoughts’: from Schiller's Wilhelm Tell. \n232. ‘the etemal-boring in woman’: alludes to ‘the etemal-womanly’, a phrase in \nthe closing chorus of Goethe's Faust (quoted in Section 236). \nmuher... ecclesia: let woman be silent in church. muher... pohticis: let woman be \nsilent in matters of pohtics. muher... muhere: let woman be silent about woman. \n235. ‘mon ami’, etc.: My friend, never permit yourself anything but folhes which \nwill give you a great deal of pleasure. \n236. ‘ella guardava suso’, etc.: she looked upward and I at her. \n237. Few words, much meaning: Kurze Rede, langer Sinn — an inversion of \nSchiller's phrase ‘der langen Rede kurzer Sin’ (Die Piccolomini) = the concise \nmeaning of the long speech. \n240. Wagner is referred to in almost all Nietzsche's books, and often he is being \nreferred to when he is not actually named (often he appears as ‘the artist’). The most \nextended discussion is to be found in The Birth of Tragedy 16-25, Richard Wagner \nin Bayreuth, Zarathustra IV (where Wagner is ‘the Sorcerer’), The Wagner Case, \n\n\nand Nietzsche contra Wagner. \n241. The statesman referred to is, of course, Bismarck. Compare the words with \nwhich the first paragraph of David Strauss ends: \nOf all the evil consequences which have followed the recent war with France perhaps the\nworst is a widespread if not universal error... that German culture too was victorious \nstruggle... This delusion... is capable of tuming our victory into a complete defeat: \ndefeat if not the extirpation of the German spirit [Geist] for the benefit of the ‘Germ\nThis was written in 1873; in 1888 Nietzsche wrote: \nNowadays the Germans are bored with intellect [Geist], the Germans mistrust intellect, \npohtics devours all seriousness for really intellectual [geistige] things — Deutschlan\nDeutschland über alles was, I fear, the end of German philosophy... (Twihght VII 1) \nHis attitude towards the Reich was consistent throughout: the Reich was \ndestructive of what was best in Germany and demanded of the Germans that which \nthey were least fitted for. \n244. ‘two souls, alas’, etc.: from Goethe's Faust, Part I Scene 2. \nKotzebue: August Friedrich Ferdinand von Kotzebue (1761-1819), one of the \nmost popular dramatists of his day. \nSand: Karl Ludwig Sand (1795-1820), the student who murdered Kotzebue. \nGemüt. warm-heartedness, ‘soul’; more famihar in the form ‘Gemüthchkeit = \ngood-fellow plus beer. \nad oculos: visibly to the eyes. \nBerhn wit and sand: the region around Berhn is notoriously arid and sandy. The \nword here translated ‘wit’ (Witz) does not imply any great degree of refinement. \nJokiness, smartness, even ‘cockney humour’ might render it better. The whole \nphrase is probably meant to be derogatory. \ndas ‘tiusche’ Volk, das Tdusche- Volk: täuschen = to deceive. This is a piece of \n\n\njoke-etymology: ‘tdusche’ is derived from ‘tiusche’, and, by imphcation, ‘deutsch’ \nfrom ‘tdusche’. The joke is effective because ‘deutsch’ does (according to the usual \naccount) derive from ‘tiusche’ (in Old High German diutisc = of the people, \nnational), as does ‘Teuton’ and ‘Dutch’. \n245. ‘Saxon Switzerland’: mountainous region near Dresden. \nnoh me tangere: do not touch me. \n251. Sybels and Treitschkes: Heinrich von Sybel (1817-95) and Heinrich von \nTreitschke (1834—96), German historians. \nanti-Jewism: Antisemiterei. res facta... nata: something made... bom. res ficta et \npicta: something invented and unreal. aere perennius: more enduring than bronze \n(Horace). \nthe March: i.e. the March of Brandenburg, the area around Berhn. \n252. Je méprise Locke’. I despise Locke. \n253. âme francaise: French soul. \n254. Victor Hugo's funeral: May 1885. \nin voluptate psychologica: in taking pleasure in psychology. \nHenri Beyle: better known by the pen-name Stendhal. \nblood and iron: a phrase of Bismarck's meaning, of course, ‘war’. \nBizet: for Nietzsche Bizet was the antithesis of Wagner, and it is in that role that \nhe appears in The Wagner Case (see especially the Foreword and Sections 1-3). \n257. The ideas expressed in this section are developed at length in the Genealogy I \nand II. \n260. The coinages Herren-Moral and Sklaven-Moral make their first appearance \nin this section. The conception of a ‘twofold prehistory of good and evil’ was first \npromulgated in Human 45, and its imphcations are further discussed and elaborated \nin the Genealogy I. \n‘gai saber’: gay science, meaning the art of the Provengal troubadours. Nietzsche \nhad adopted the phrase as the title of his Die frohhche Wissenschaft which, so that \nthere should be no doubt as to what that German phrase was intended to translate, \nhe subtitled ‘la gaya scienza’. \n\n\n263. For another attack on ‘the cultured’, see Zarathustra II 14. \nDifférence engendre haine: Difference engenders hate. \n264. furca... naturam expellere... usque recurret: alludes to Horace's ‘Try to drive \nout nature with a pitchfork, it always retums.’ \n265. inter pares: among equals. \n269. For another, more detailed analysis of Jesus, see Anti-Christ 28-37 and 39. \n271. Compare with the last two sentences the main argument and action of \nZarathustra IV. \n274. ‘Raphael without hands’: alludes to the words of the painter Conti in \nLessing's Emiha Galotti: ‘or do you think, Prince, that Raphael would not still have \nbeen the greatest genius of painting if he had unfortunately been bom without \nhands?” \n275. Compare Section 26. \n284. four virtues: ‘sympathy’ = Mitgefühl, not Mitleid (pity), and might perhaps be \nbetter rendered ‘empathy’. There is another hst of four virtues in Dawn 556 \n(honesty, bravery, magnanimity, pohteness). Pohteness has now become a ‘roguish \nvice’. \n285. Compare Zarathustra II 18 and 22. \n286. ‘Here is the prospect free’, etc.: from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust II. \nThe whole movement of this scene is upwards: one group after another is left below \nas the ‘immortal part’ of Faust is bome higher and higher. \n289. abyss... ground... ‘foundation’: Abgrund... Grunde... Begründung’. \n290. sympathy: Mitgefiihl. \n293. ‘gay science’, to make the matter plain: fröhhche Wissenschaft’, um es den \nDeutschen zu verdeuthchen. The last clause means: to elucidate it for the Germans. \nPlays upon deutsch’ and ‘deuthch’ (clear) occur elsewhere in Nietzsche — he \nhumorously (and seriously) supposes them to be opposites. \n294. For examples of Nietzsche on laughter, see Human 553, Wanderer 173, Gay \nScience 1, 200, Zarathustra 17, Il 13, IV 13 (16-20), Will to Power 990. \n\n\nlaughter is a bad infirmity’, etc: quoted in German and translated back. \n295. The quotation of the first part of this section in Ecce Homo (III 6), prefaced \nby the admonition that no one is to try to guess who is being described, suggests \nthat Nietzsche is here describing himself. \nEpode. A poem in fifteen stanzas, with a somewhat comphcated rhyme scheme \nand strongly marked rhythm. Two kinds of metrical translation would, of course, be \npossible: one which preserved the existing rhyme scheme and rhythm and one \nwhich rewrote the poem in a new metre. But neither would, in this case, be \nappropriate: the former would be the more faithful to Nietzsche's intentions, but the \nresult would be a very ugly and hard-to-read poem because of the distortion and \ncontortion of language necessary for preserving something of the meaning; the \nlatter would certainly result in a better poem but would deviate so far from the \nauthor's intentions as to be a falsification of them. Nietzsche's normal form of \ncommunication was prose, and he wrote a quantity of prose, notably but not only in \nZarathustra, of the kind usually called ‘poetic’: he found no difficulty in employing \nin prose the more highly emotional or rhapsodic language which was in the \nnineteeth century the hallmark of the vocabulary of poetry, and there is httle in his \npoems which would seem out of place in his ‘poetic’ prose. In a poem such as the \npresent one, therefore, that which is distinctive is not the vocabulary or the thought \nbut precisely the rhyme-scheme and strongly marked rhythm. (This is more \nimmediately obvious in the case of “To the Mistral’, the poem with which The Gay \nScience closes: based on a somewhat similar scheme to ‘From High Mountains’, the \npoem's whole significance resides in its fast-running rhythm — a very successful \nimitation of speed and energy.) I have therefore thought it best to provide a prose \ntranslation which is, I hope, readable as a ‘prose poem’, and to indicate the shape of \nthe original poem here. I reproduce the opening and closing stanzas. \nO Lebens Mittag! Feierhche Zeit! \nO Sommergarten! \nUnruhig Glück im Stehn und Spähn und Warten: — \nDer Freunde harr’ ich, Tag und Nacht bereit, \nWo bleibt ihr, Freunde? Kommt! 's ist Zeit!
