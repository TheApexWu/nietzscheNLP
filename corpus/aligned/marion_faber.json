Whenever explaining \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers 9 \nhow a philosopher’s most far-fetched metaphysical propositions \nhave come about, in fact, one always does well (and wisely) to ask \nfirst: ‘What morality is it (is he) aiming at?

Imagine a creature constituted like nature, \nprodigal beyond measure, neutral beyond measure, with no purpose \nor conscience, with no compassion or fairness, fertile and desolate \nand uncertain all at once; imagine Indifference itself as a power: \nhow could you live according to this indifference? To live—isn’t \nthat precisely the desire to be other than this nature? Doesn’t life \nmean weighing, preferring, being unjust, having limits, wanting to \nbe Different? And even if the real meaning of your imperative \n‘to live according to nature’ is ‘to live according to life-—how could \nyou do otherwise? Why make a principle out of something that you \nalready are and needs must be? \nThe truth is something else entirely: while you pretend to delight \nin reading the canon of your law from nature, you want the opposite, \nyou curious play-actors and self-deceivers! In your pride you want \nto dictate your morality, your ideals to nature, incorporate them \ninto nature, of all things; you demand that nature be ‘according to \nStoics’; you would like to make all existence exist in accordance with \nyour own image alone—for the great and unending glorification and \nuniversalization of Stoicism! With all your love of truth, you force \nyourselves to stare so long, so constantly, so hypnotically at nature \nthat you see it falsely, that is, stoically, and you become incapable \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers II \nof seeing it otherwise. And then out of some unfathomable arro- \ngance you conceive the lunatic hope that because you know how to \ntyrannize yourself (Stoicism is self-tyranny), nature too can be tyr- \nannized: for isn’t the Stoic a part of nature? ... \nBut this is an old, eternal story: what took place back then with \nthe Stoics is still taking place today, whenever a philosophy begins \nto believe in itself. It always creates the world according to its own \nimage, it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical drive \nitself, the most spiritual form of the will to power, to ‘creation of \nthe world’, to the causa prima.* \nI0 \nThe zeal and subtlety (I would almost like to say ‘cunning’) with \nwhich everyone in Europe today is raising the question ‘of the real \nand the apparent world’ give us cause for thought and for list- \nening—and anyone who hears only a ‘will to truth’ in the \nbackground certainly does not have the sharpest ears. In a few rare, \nisolated cases a will to truth really may have played a part, an \nextravagant or adventurous mood, a metaphysician’s craving for the \n\n\nlost cause, a will that ultimately prefers a handful of ‘certainty’ to \na whole wagonload of beautiful possibilities; there may even be \nsome puritanical fanatics of conscience* who would rather lay down \ntheir lives for a certain Nothing than for an uncertain Something. \nBut however valiant the gestures of such virtue, this is nihilism, \nthe sign of a despairing, mortally weary soul. With stronger, more \nvital thinkers, still thirsty for life, things are different: they take \nsides against appearance and are already pronouncing the word \n‘perspectivist’ with arrogance; they take the credibility of their own \nbody about as seriously as the credibility of the appearance that \n‘the earth stands still’. They seem to be ready cheerfully to let \ndrop from their hands their surest possession (for what do we \nbelieve in more surely than our bodies?) and who knows whether \nat bottom they might not want to regain something that they once \npossessed even more surely, something from the old homestead of \nbelief of earlier times, the ‘immortal soul’ perhaps, or ‘the old \ngod’—ideas, in short, that led to a life that was better, more robust \nand serene, than the one our ‘modern ideas’ can lead to? In this \nquestion, there is mistrust of modern ideas, disbelief in everything \n12 Beyond Good and Evil \nconstructed yesterday and today; there may be a slight element of \ndisgust and contempt, from those no longer able to tolerate the \nhighly eclectic conceptual bric-a-brac that today’s so-called posi- \ntivism brings to the market place; those with more fastidious taste \nare revolted by the fairground motley and frippery of all these \nreality-philosophists, who have nothing new or genuine apart from \ntheir motley. We should credit the sceptical anti-realists and know- \nledge-microscopists of today with at least this much, | think: we \nhave seen nothing to refute their instinct to escape from modern \nreality—thceir retrograde backroads are no concern of ours! What \nis important about them is not that they want to go ‘back’, but that \nthey want to go-—a may! With a little more strength, more buoyancy, \ncourage, artistry, they would want to go beyond—and not back! \nII \nPeople today are trying, it seems to me, to divert attention from \nKant’s real influence on German philosophy, trying especially to \nevade what he himself considered his great value. Kant was most \nproud of his table of categories; holding it in his hands he said, \n‘This is the most difficult thing that ever could be undertaken for \nthe benefit of metaphysics.’ \nBut let us understand what this ‘could be’ really implies! He was \n\n\nproud of having discovered in man a new faculty, the faculty to \nmake synthetic a priori judgements. Granted that he was deceiving \nhimself about his discovery: nevertheless, the development and \nrapid flowering of German philosophy stem from this pride \nand from the rivalry of his disciples to discover if at all possible \nsomething worthy of even more pride—and in any event ‘new \nfaculties”! \nBut let’s think about it, it is high time. ‘How are synthetic a \npriori judgements possible? wondered Kant, and what did he \nanswer? They are facilitated by a faculty:* unfortunately, however, \nhe did not say this in four words, but so cumbersomely, so venerably, \nand with such an expense of German profundity and ornateness \nthat people misheard the comical miaiserie allemande* in such an \nanswer. They were ecstatic about this new faculty, in fact, and the \nrejoicing reached its height when Kant discovered a moral faculty \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers 13 \nin man as well. (For at that time Germans were still moral, and \nnot yet ‘real-political’.*) \nThere followed the honeymoon of German philosophy; all the \nyoung theologians of the Tiibingen Stift* headed right for the \nbushes—they were all looking for ‘faculties’. And what all didn’t \nthey find, in that innocent, rich, still youthful era of the German \nspirit when the malicious elf Romanticism was still piping and \nsinging, back when no one yet had learned to distinguish between \n‘finding’ and ‘inventing’!* They found above all a faculty for the \n‘extra-sensual’: Schelling christened it ‘intellectual intuition’,* thus \nmeeting the dearest desires of his essentially pious-desirous \nGermans. One can do no greater injustice to this whole arrogant, \nenthusiastic movement (which was youth itself, however audaciously \nit may have cloaked itself in grey, senile concepts) than to take it \nseriously and treat it with anything like moral indignation. Enough, \npeople grew older—the dream vanished. The time came for them \nto rub their foreheads: they are rubbing them still today. They had \nbeen dreaming, and the first among them had been old Kant. \n‘Facilitated by a faculty’—that’s what he had said, or at least that’s \nwhat he had meant. But what kind of an answer is that? What kind \nof explanation? Isn’t it rather simply repeating the question? How \ncan opium make us sleep? It is ‘facilitated by a faculty’, the virtus \ndormitiva, answers that doctor in Molière, \nquia est in eo virtus dormitiva \ncujus est natura sensus assoupire.* \n\n\nBut answers like these belong in comedy, and for the Kantian \nquestion ‘How are synthetic.a priori judgements possible?’ it is \nhigh time to substitute another question: ‘Why is the belief in \nsuch judgements necessary?’—it is time to understand that for the \npurpose of preserving creatures of our kind, we must believe that \nsuch judgements are true; which means, of course, that they could \nstill be false judgements. Or to put it more clearly, and crudely and \ncompletely: synthetic a priori judgements should not ‘be possible’ \nat all; we have no right to them, in our mouths they are only false \njudgements. Yet the belief in their truth happens to be necessary \nas one of the foreground beliefs and appearances that constitute \nthe perspective-optics of life. \nAnd, finally, remembering the enormous effect that ‘German \n14 Beyond Good and Evil \nphilosophy’ exercised throughout Europe (one understands, I hope, \nwhy it deserves quotation marks?), let no one doubt that a certain \nvirtus dormitiva had a part in it: amidst the noble men of leisure, \nthe moralists, mystics, artists, the partial Christians, and political \nobscurantists of every nation, people were delighted that German \nphilosophy offered an antidote to the still overpowering sensualism \npouring into this century from the previous one, in short: ‘sensus \nassoupire’. .."

Let \nus say that in every act of willing there is first of all a multiplicity \nof feelings, namely the feeling of the condition we are moving away \nfrom and the feeling of the condition we are moving towards; the \nfeeling of this ‘away’ and this ‘towards’; and then a concomitant \nfeeling in the muscles that, without our actually moving ‘arms and \nlegs’, comes into play out of a kind of habit, whenever we ‘will’. \nSecond, just as we must recognize feeling, and indeed many kinds \n\n\nof feeling, as an ingredient of the will, so must we likewise recognize \nthinking: in every act of will there is a commanding thought, and \nwe must not deceive ourselves that this thought can be separated \noff from ‘willing’, as if we would then have any will left over! \nThird, the will is not merely a complex of feelings and thoughts, \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers 19 \nit is above all an emotion, and in fact the emotion of command. \nWhat is called ‘freedom of the will’ is essentially the emotion of \nsuperiority felt towards the one who must obey: ‘I am free, “he” \nmust obey.’ This consciousness lies in every will, as does also a \ntense alertness, a direct gaze concentrated on one thing alone, an \nunconditional assessment that ‘now we must have this and nothing \nelse’, an inner certainty that obedience will follow, and everything \nelse that goes along with the condition of giving commands. A \nperson who wills: this person is commanding a Something in \nhimself that obeys, or that he thinks is obeying. \nBut let us now consider the strangest thing about the will, about \nthis multifarious thing that the common people call by one word \nalone. In any given case, we both command and obey, and when \nwe obey we know the feelings of coercion, pressure, oppression, \nresistance, and agitation that begin immediately after the act of \nwill. On the other hand, we are in the habit of ignoring or over- \nlooking this division by means of the synthetic concept ‘I’. Thus, \na whole series of erroneous conclusions and therefore of false \nassessments of the will itself has been appended to willing in such \na way that the person who wills now believes with complete faith \nthat willing 7s enough for action. Because in the vast majority of \ncases, willing has only occurred when there is also the expectation \nthat the effect of the command—that is obedience, action—will \nfollow, this impression has been translated into the feeling that there \nis a necessary effect; suffice it to say, the person willing thinks with \nsome degree of certainty that will and action are somehow one: he \nattributes his success in carrying out his willing to the will itself \nand in this way enjoys an increase in that feeling of power that \naccompanies any kind of success. ‘Freedom of the will’—that is \nthe word for that complex pleasurable condition experienced by the \nperson willing who commands and simultaneously identifies himself \nwith the one who executes the command—as such he can share in \nenjoying a triumph over resistance, while secretly judging that it \nwas actually his will that overcame that resistance. Thus the person \nwilling adds to his pleasurable feeling as commander the pleasurable \nfeelings of the successful executing instrument, the serviceable \n‘underwill’ or under-soul (our body after all is nothing but a social \nstructure of many souls). L'effet c'est mot:* what is occurring here \noccurs in every well-structured happy community where the ruling \n\n\n20 Beyond Good and Evil \nclass identifies with the successes of the community as a whole. As \nwe have said, every act of willing is simply a matter of commanding \nand obeying, based on a social structure of many ‘souls’; for this \nreason a philosopher should claim the right to comprehend willing \nfrom within the sphere of ethics: ethics, that is, understood as the \ntheory of hierarchical relationships among which the phenomenon \n‘life’ has its origins."

      "text": "That individual philosophical concepts are not something isolated, \nsomething unto themselves, but rather grow up in reference and \nrelatedness to one another; that however suddenly and arbitrarily \nthey seem to emerge in the history of thought, they are as much a \npart of one system as are the branches of fauna on one continent: \nthis is revealed not least by the way the most disparate philosophers \ninvariably fill out one particular basic schema of possible philo- \nsophies. Under some unseen spell they always run around the same \norbit: however independent they may feel, one from the other, with \ntheir will to criticism or to system, something in them is leading \nthem, driving them all to follow one another in a certain order— \nan inborn taxonomy and affinity of concepts. In truth their thinking \nis much less an act of discovery than an act of recognizing anew, \nremembering anew, a return back home to a distant, ancient uni- \nversal economy of the soul from out of which those concepts \ninitially grew: philosophizing is thus a kind of atavism of the highest \norder. This easily explains the strange family resemblance of all \nIndian, Greek, and German philosophizing. Wherever linguistic \naffinity, above all, is present, everything necessary for an analogous \ndevelopment and sequence of philosophical systems will inevitably \nbe on hand from the beginning, thanks to the shared philosophy \nof grammar (I mean thanks to being unconsciously ruled and \nguided by similar grammatical functions), just as the way to certain \nother possibilities for interpreting the world will seem to be blocked. \nPhilosophers from the Ural-Altaic linguistic zone (where the \nconcept of the subject is least developed) will most probably look \ndifferently ‘into the world’ and will be found on other paths than \nIndo-Germans or Muslims: and in the last analysis, the spell of \nOn the Prejudices of Philosophers 21 \n\n\ncertain grammatical functions is the spell of physiological value \njudgements and conditions of race. \nThis by way of a rejection of Locke’s superficiality* concerning \nthe origin of ideas. \n2I \nThe causa sui* is the best internal contradiction ever devised, a \nkind of logical freak or outrage: but because of man’s excessive \npride we have come to be deeply and terribly entangled with this \nparticular nonsense. The yearning for ‘freedom of the will’ in the \nsuperlative metaphysical sense that unfortunately still prevails in \nthe minds of the half-educated, the yearning to bear complete and \nfinal responsibility for one’s own actions and to relieve God, the \nworld, one’s ancestors, coincidence, society from it—this is really \nnothing less than being that same causa sui and, with a daring \ngreater than Miinchhausen’s,* dragging yourself by your hair out \nof the swamp of nothingness and into existence. Now, if someone \ncan see through the cloddish simplicity of this famous concept ‘free \nwill’ and eliminate it from his mind, I would then ask him to take \nhis ‘enlightenment’ a step further and likewise eliminate from his \nhead the opposite of the non-concept ‘free will’: I mean the ‘unfree \nwil? which amounts to a misuse of cause and effect. One should \nnot make the mistake of concretizing ‘cause’ and ‘effect’? as do \nthe natural scientists (and whoever else today naturalizes in their \nthinking . . .), in conformity with the prevalent mechanistic foolish- \nness that pushes and tugs at the cause until it ‘has an effect’; ‘cause’ \nand ‘effect’ should be used only as pure concepts, as conventional \nfictions for the purpose of description or communication, and \nnot for explanation. In the ‘in itself’ there is nothing of ‘causal \nassociations’, of ‘necessity’, of ‘psychological constraint’; the effect \ndoes not follow ‘upon the cause’, no ‘law’ governs it. We alone are \nthe ones who have invented causes, succession, reciprocity, rela- \ntivity, coercion, number, law, freedom, reason, purpose; and if we \nproject, if we mix this world of signs into things as if it were an \n‘in itself’, we act once more as we have always done, that is, \nmythologically. The ‘unfree will’ is mythology: in real life it is only \na matter of strong and weak wills. \nWhenever a thinker sniffs out coercion, necessity, obligation, \n22 Beyond Good and Evil \npressure, constraint in any ‘causal connection’ or ‘psychological \nnecessity’, it is almost always a symptom of where his own inad- \n\n\nequacy lies: to feel this particular way is revealing—the person is \nrevealing himself. And if I have observed correctly, the ‘constraint \nof the will is always conceived as a problem from two completely \nOpposite standpoints, but always in a profoundly personal way: the \none group will not hear of relinquishing their ‘responsibility’, their \nbelief in themselves, their personal right to take ‘heir credit (the vain \nraces are of this type); conversely, the other group wants to be \nresponsible for nothing, guilty of nothing, and out of their inner \nself-contempt they yearn to cast off their own selves one way or \nanother. When this latter group writes books nowadays, they tend \nto take up the cause of criminals; a sort of socialistic compassion \nis their nicest disguise. And indeed, it is surprising how much \nprettier the fatalism of the weak-willed can look when it presents \nitself as ‘la religion de la souffrance humaine’;* that is what zt \nmeans by ‘good taste’."

Along \nwith it, to be sure, came an ominous new superstition, a peculiar \nnarrowness of interpretation took hold: the origin of an action was \ninterpreted in the most precise terms as itself originating in an \nintention; everyone was united in the belief that the value of \nan action lay in the value of its intention. Intention as the entire \nsource and past history of an action: almost right up into modern \ntimes this prejudice has determined how moral judgements have \nbeen made on earth, praising, blaming, judging, philosophizing. \nThe Free Spirit 33 \nBut now that human beings are again gaining a deeper self- \nawareness, shouldn’t we weigh another reversal and fundamental \nshift in values—might we not be standing at the threshold of a \nperiod that, to put it negatively, would at first have to be described \nas extra-moral? Is not the suspicion growing, at least among us \nimmoralists, that an action’s decisive value is demonstrated precisely \nby that part of it that is not intentional, do we not suspect that all \nof an action’s intentionality, everything that can be seen or known \nabout it, that can be ‘conscious’ about it, is still part of its surface \nand skin—which, like all skin, reveals something, but hides even \nmore? In short, we believe that the intention is but a sign or a \nsymptom, first of all requiring interpretation, and furthermore that \nit is a sign with so many meanings that as a consequence it has \nalmost none in and of itself; we believe that morality in its earlier \nsense, intention-morality, was a prejudice, something precipitous \nor perhaps preliminary, something of the order of astrology or \nalchemy, but in any event something that must be overcome. The \novercoming of morality, or even (in a certain sense) the self-over- \ncoming of morality: let that be the name for the long, clandestine \nwork that was kept in reserve for the most subtle and honest \n(and also the most malicious) people of conscience today, living \ntouchstones of the human heart.—"

But anyone who would try to claim that the falsity \nof the world is due to our thought process, to our ‘intellect’ (an \nhonourable way out, taken by every conscious or unconscious advo- \ncatus det),* anyone who takes this world with all its space, time, \nform, movement, to be falsely inferred, would at the very least have \ngood reason to end by distrusting the thought process itself—for \nwouldn’t this thought process have made us the victims of the \ngreatest hoax ever? And what guarantce would we have that it \nwouldn’t go on doing what it has always done? In all seriousness, \nthere is something touching and awe-inspiring in the innocence of \nthinkers that allows them even nowadays to request honest answers \nfrom their consciousness: about whether it is ‘substantial’, for \nexample, or why it insists on keeping the outside world at such a \ndistance, and all sorts of other questions of that kind.

In any but moral terms, our faith in immediate certainties is \nstupid, and does us no great honour!

Why not? It is nothing but a moral prejudice \nto consider truth more valuable than appearance; it is, in fact, the \nThe Free Spirit 35 \nmost poorly proven assumption in the world. We should admit at \nleast this much: there would be no life at all if not on the basis of \nperspectivist assessments and appearances; and if one wanted to do \naway with the ‘apparent world’ entirely, as some valiantly enthusi- \nastic and foolish philosophers want to do, well then, assuming that \npeople like you could do that—then at the very least there would \nbe nothing left of your ‘truth’, either! Really, why should we be \nforced to assume that there is an essential difference between ‘true’ \nand ‘false’ in the first place? Isn’t it enough to assume that there \nare degrees of apparency and, so to speak, lighter and darker \nshadows and hues of appearance—different valeurs,* to use the \nlanguage of painters? Why should the world that is relevant to us \nnot be a fiction? And if someone asks, ‘But mustn’t a fiction have \nan author?’ shouldn’t we answer him bluntly, ‘Why? Mustn’t this \n‘mustn’t’ be part of the fiction, too, perhaps? Aren’t we allowed to \nbe a little bit ironic, not only about predicates and objects, but also \nabout subjects?

Among contempor- \nary non-religious Germans, for example, I find all kinds of ‘free- \nthinkers’ with all kinds of backgrounds, but above all else a majority \nwhose religious instincts have disintegrated over the generations \nbecause of the work ethic, so that they no longer have any idea at \nall of the possible use of religion, and merely take note, as it were, \nwith a kind of dumb astonishment that religions exist in the world. \nThese good people feel that there are enough claims on their time \nalready, whether because of their business affairs or their rec- \nreational activities, not to mention their ‘fatherland’ and their \n52 Beyond Good and Evil \nnewspapers and their ‘family obligations’: it would seem that they \nhave no time left over for religion, especially since they never can \nfigure out whether going to church would be classified as a new \nbusiness deal or a new recreational activity—for one can’t possibly \ngo to church, they tell themselves, just to spoil one’s good mood. \nThey are not hostile to religious customs; if in certain cases \nsomcone (the state, for example) requires them to take part in such \ncustoms, they do what is required as they do other required things: \nwith a patient, modest seriousness and without much curiosity or \ndiscomfort—they live too much outside and apart from these \nmatters even to feel the need for their own Pro or Con.

He was born and raised to \ntreat religious matters with a practical indifference that tends to be \nsublimated into fastidious circumspection, making him avoid \ncontact with religious people or things; and it may be precisely \nbecause he is so deeply tolerant and humane that he tries to escape \nthe subtle state of distress that accompanies even tolerance. \nEvery age has invented its own divine type of naiveté, which \nother periods may find enviable—and how much naiveté, how much \nadmirable, childlike, and endlessly foolish naiveté lies in the scho- \nThe Religious Disposition 53 \nlar’s faith in his own superiority, in his good conscience for being \ntolerant, in the simple clueless confidence with which he instinct- \nively treats the religious person as an inferior and lower type, one \nthat he himself has grown away from, grown beyond, grown above— \nhe, the presumptuous little dwarf and vulgarian, the diligent darting \nheadworker and handworker of ‘ideas’, of ‘modern ideas’!"

The influence that can be exerted with the help \nof religion is an influence for selecting and breeding, and is always \nnecessarily as destructive as it is creative and formative; depending \non the sort of people who come under the spell and protection of \nreligion, its influence can be manifold and diverse. \n\n\nFor those who are strong and independent, prepared and pre- \ndestined to command, who embody the intellect and the art of a \ngoverning race, religion is one further means to overcome obstacles, \nto learn to rule: as a bond that ties together rulers and subjects, \nrevealing and surrendering to the former the consciences of the \nlatter, their hidden and innermost secret, the wish to escape \nthe bonds of obedience. And if, because of their high spirituality, \na few of these nobly-born natures are inclined to a more removed \nand contemplative life, reserving for themselves only the most \nsubtle form of authority (over selected disciples or brothers of the \norder), they can use religion as a means to ensure their repose \nwhen confronted with the noisy exertions of the cruder type of \nauthority, and their purity when confronted with the necessary \nfilth of every kind of political activity. That is how the Brahmans \nunderstood it, for example: with the help of a religious organization, \nthey gave themselves the power to appoint the kings for the \ncommon people, while they themselves remained apart and outside, \nThe Religious Disposition 55 \nfeeling that their own duties were more important than those of \nroyalty. \nMeanwhile, religion also gives guidance and an opportunity to \nprepare for eventual authority and command to a portion of the \ngoverned, to those slowly rising classes and ranks whose successful \nmarriage patterns have ensured that the strong desire of their will, \ntheir will to self-rule, is always growing. Religion can offer them \nenough incitements and temptations to go the ways of higher \nspirituality, to test their feelings of great self-control, silence, and \nsolitude: asceticism and puritanism are the virtually indispensable \nmeans to educate and improve a race that wants to overcome its \norigin in the rabble and work itself up to eventual authority. \nTo the ordinary people, finally, to the vast majority who exist to \nserve and be generally useful and must exist only to that end, \nreligion offers an inestimable contentment with their own situation \nand nature, an ongoing peace of heart, improved obedience, joy and \nsorrow shared with their own kind, and something in the way \nof transfiguration and beautification, something that justifies their \neveryday lives, all the baseness, all the semi-animal poverty of \ntheir souls. Being religious and finding a religious significance to \nlife sheds sunshine on these constantly afflicted people, even \nenabling them to bear the sight of themselves; it has the same effect \nthat Epicurean philosophy tends to have on a higher class of suf- \nferer: refreshing, purifying, exploiting suffering, as it were, and \nultimately even sanctifying and justifying it. There is perhaps \n\n\nnothing so admirable about Christianity and Buddhism as their \nskill in showing even the lowliest people how piety can place them \nwithin an illusory higher order of things and thus enable them to \nremain content with the real order, within which they certainly live \na harsh (and this harshness is exactly what’s needed!) life."

      "number": 186,
      "text": "THe moral sensibility in Europe these days is as subtle, mature, \ndifferentiated, sensitive, refined, as the relevant ‘science of morality’ \nis still young, raw, clumsy, and crude: an attractive antithesis \nwhich is sometimes revealed in the person of the moralist himself. \nEven the term ‘science of morality’, considering what it describes, \nis much too arrogant and offends good taste—which always tends \nto prefer more modest terms. We should sternly admit to ourselves \nwhat will be required in the long term, what the only right course \nis for the moment: that is, to gather the material, establish the \nconcepts, and organize the abundance of subtle feelings and distinc- \ntions in the area of values, as they live, grow, procreate, and perish; \nand perhaps we should also attempt to illustrate the more frequently \nrecurring forms of this living crystallization—in preparation for a \ntaxonomy of morals. True, such modesty has not so far been the \nrule. The moment philosophers were concerned with morality as \na science, all of them, with a ridiculous stiff solemnity, demanded \nof themselves something much greater, more ambitious, more \nsolemn: they wanted to account for morality—and every philosopher \nto date has thought that he has done so; morality itself, however, \nwas taken as a ‘given’. In their clumsy pride, how remote they were \nfrom the seemingly modest task of description, forgotten in dust \nand decay, although even the most delicate hands and senses could \nhardly be delicate enough for it! Precisely because the moral philo- \nsophers knew moral facta* only roughly, in arbitrary excerpts or \nrandom condensations, knew them as the morality of their neigh- \nbourhood, say, or of their class, their Church, the Zeitgeist, their \nclimate or region; precisely because they were not well informed \nabout peoples, epochs, past histories and were not even particularly \ncurious about them, they never did catch sight of the real problems \nof morality—all of which come to light only by comparing many \nTowards a Natural History of Morals 75 \nmoralities. As strange as it may sound, in every previous ‘science \nof morality’ the problem of morality itself was missing; there was \nno suspicion that it might be something problematic. What the \nphilosophers called ‘accounting for morality’ and expected of them- \nselves was, viewed in the right light, only an erudite form of true \n\n\nbelief in the prevailing morality, a new medium for expressing it, \nand thus itself a part of the state of affairs within a particular \nmorality. Indeed, in the last analysis it was a way of forbidding that \nthis morality might be construed as a problem—and in any event it \nwas the opposite of a testing, analysing, doubting, dissecting of their \nparticular belief. Just listen, for example, to the almost admirable \ninnocence with which Schopenhauer portrays his own task, and \ndraw your conclusions as to the scientific nature of a ‘science’ \nwhose past masters still talk like children or old women: “The \nprinciple’, he writes in The Fundamental Problems of Morality,* ‘the \naxiom about whose content all moralists really agree, neminem laede, \nimmo omnes, quantum potes, juva*—that is really the tenet that all \nmoralists endeavour to account for—the rea/ foundation of morality, \nwhich people have been seeking for thousands of years like the \nphilosophers’ stone.’ \nTo be sure, it may be very difficult to account for the tenet he \ncites (everyone knows that Schopenhauer himself was not successful \nin doing so), and anyone who has ever thoroughly appreciated how \ntastelessly false and sentimental this tenet is in a world whose \nessence is the will to power, may want to be reminded that Schopen- \nhauer, although he was a pessimist, rea//y—played the flute... \nEvery day, after dinner: just read what his biographer says about \nthis. And by the way, may we not inquire whether a pessimist who \ndenies God and the world, but stops short at the problem of morality, \nsays Yes to morality, to a /aede-neminem morality and plays the \nflute: well then? is this person really—a pessimist?"

The essential, invaluable \nthing about every moral code is that it is one long coercion: in \norder to understand Stoicism or Port-Royal* or Puritanism, just \nthink of the coercion that every language has employed up till now \nin achieving its strength and freedom—the coercion of metre, the \ntyranny of rhyme and rhythm. How much trouble the poets and \norators of every people (not to exclude certain contemporary prose \nwriters, in whose ear an unshakeable conscience resides) have put \nthemselves to—‘for the sake of folly’, as utilitarian fools say, thus \nfancying themselves clever; ‘in subservience to tyrannical laws’, as \nanarchists say, thus imagining themselves ‘free’, even freethinking. \nBut the strange fact is that everything on earth that exists or has \nexisted by way of freedom, subtlety, daring, dance, and perfect \nsureness, whether it be in ideas, or in governance, or in oratory \nand rhetoric, in the arts as well as in manners, has developed only \nby virtue of the ‘tyranny of such despotic laws’; and seriously, it is \nvery likely that this is what is ‘nature’ and ‘natural’—and not that \nlaisser-aller| Every artist knows how far from the feeling of anything- \ngoes his ‘most natural’ condition is, the free ordering, arranging, \ndeciding, shaping that occurs in his moments of ‘inspiration’—and \nhow delicately and strictly, especially at such moments, he obeys the \nthousandfold laws whose very exactness and rigour make mockery \nTowards a Natural History of Morals 77 \nof all conceptual formulations (even the most solid concept, by \ncomparison, has something muzzy, multifarious, ambiguous—). To \nrepeat, it seems that the essential thing, both ‘in heaven and on \nearth’, is that there be a protracted period of unidirectional obedi- \nence: in the long run, that is how something emerged and emerges \nthat makes life on earth worth living: virtue, for example, or art, \nmusic, dance, reason, spirituality—something _ transfiguring, \nelegant, wild, and divine. The long constraint of the spirit; the \nreluctant coercion in the communicability of thoughts; the thinker’s \nself-imposed discipline to think within guidelines set up by court \nor Church, or according to Aristotelian assumptions; the long- \nstanding spiritual will to interpret every event according to a \n\n\nChristian scheme and to rediscover and justify the Christian God \nin every chance incident—all this violence, arbitrariness, harshness, \nhorror, nonsense has turned out to be the means by which the \nEuropean spirit was bred to be strong, ruthlessly curious, and \nbeautifully nimble. Admittedly, much irreplaceable energy and \nspirit had to be suppressed, suffocated, and spoiled in the process \n(for here as everywhere ‘nature’ reveals her true colours in all her \nextravagant and indifferent grandeur, which is infuriating but also \nnoble). For thousands of years European thinkers thought only in \norder to prove something (today on the other hand we are sceptical \nof any thinker who ‘has something to prove’). They already knew \nin advance what was supposed to emerge as a result of their most \nrigorous meditation, rather as once in Asian astrology, or as is \nstill the case today in harmless Christian-ethical interpretations of \nimmediate personal experiences ‘for the glory of God’ or ‘for the \nsoul’s salvation’. This kind of tyranny, this despotism, this stern, \ngrandiose stupidity educated the spirit: it would seem that slavery, \nboth in the cruder and the finer sense, is also the indispensable \nmeans to discipline and cultivate* the spirit. Whichever moral code \nwe inspect in that light, its ‘nature’ teaches us to hate the excessive \nfreedom of /Jaisser-aller and instils a need for limited horizons, for \nimmediate tasks—it teaches us to narrow our perspective, and thus \nin a certain sense, to be stupid, as a precondition for life and \ngrowth. ‘Thou shalt obey, obey somebody, and for a long time: or \nelse you will perish and lose your last remnant of self-respect’— \nthis seems to me to be nature’s moral imperative, and to be sure it \nis neither ‘categorical’, as old Kant demanded (hence the ‘or else’), \n78 Beyond Good and Evil \nnor is it addressed to individuals (what should it care about \nindividuals!), but rather to peoples, races, epochs, classes, and above \nall to the whole animal ‘human’, to human beings im general."

For the bad man does himself harm; he \nwould not do it if he knew that the bad was bad. In accordance, \nthe bad man is bad only through error; if we remove his error from \nhim, we necessarily make him—good.”* \nThis kind of argument reeks of the rabble, who focus only on \nTowards a Natural History of Morals 79 \nthe nasty consequences of a bad action and are actually judging \nthat ‘it is stupid to act badly’ while they unhesitatingly take ‘good’ \nto be synonymous with ‘useful and pleasant’. We can immediately \nassume that any other moral utilitarianism has a similar origin and \nfollow our nose: we will seldom go astray. \nPlato did everything he could to interpret something subtle and \nnoble (himself, most of all) into the tenet of his teacher. He was \nthe most audacious of interpreters, taking up the whole of Socrates \nas if it were nothing but a popular tune or folksong of the street, \nand varying it into the infinite and impossible—that is, into all of \nhis own masks and multiplicities. To speak in jest, and with Homer \nto boot: what might a Platonic Socrates be, if not, Tlod00¢ \nTlAdtowv, dmOev te TAatwv, péoon te ipara.” \nIQI \n\n\nThe old theological problem of ‘faith’ versus ‘knowledge’ (or, more \nprecisely, instinct versus reason); the question of whether our value \njudgements give more authority to instinct than to a rationality \nwhich wishes to know that judgements and actions are made for a \nreason, according to a ‘why’, that is, according to their expedience \nor utility—this is the same old moral problem that first appeared \nin the person of Socrates and that divided opinion long before \nChristianity. Of course Socrates himself, his taste shaped by his \ntalent (as a superior dialectician), at first took the side of reason; \nand really, what did he do throughout his life but laugh at the \nclumsy incompetence of his noble Athenians who like all noble men \nwere men of instinct and never could give enough information \nabout the reasons for their actions. In the end, however, secretly \nand quietly, he also laughed at himself: interrogating himself with \nthe finest insights of his conscience, he found the same difficulty \nand incompetence. But why then, he argued to himself, must we \nfree ourselves of our instincts! We have to help both them and \nreason come into their own—we have to follow our instincts, but \nconvince our reason to lend them a helping hand with good argu- \nments. This was the real duplicity of that great ironist, so full of \nsecrets; he induced his conscience to content itself with a sort \nof self-deception: at bottom he had grasped the irrational aspect of \nmoral judgements. \n80 Beyond Good and Evil \nPlato, more innocent in such matters and lacking the plebeian’s \ncraftiness, wanted to exert all his energy (more energy than any \nprevious philosopher had ever had!) to prove to himself that reason \nand instinct, left to their own devices, move towards one single \ngoal, towards the good, towards ‘God’; and ever since Plato, all \ntheologians and philosophers have been on the same track—that is \nto say, up until now instinct, or as Christians say, ‘faith’, or as I \nsay, ‘the herd’ has won the day in matters of morality. We have to \nmake an exception of Descartes, the father of rationalism (and \ntherefore the grandfather of the revolution), who granted authority \nto reason alone: but reason is only a tool, and Descartes was \nsuperficial."

Considering, then, that obedi- \nence has until now been bred and practised best and longest among \nhumans, we can surely assume that everyone on average is born \nwith a need to obey, as a kind of formal conscience that decrees: \n‘Thou shalt do certain things without question, refrain from certain \nthings without question’, in short ‘thou shalt’. This need seeks to \nsatisfy its hunger and fill its form with some content; it helps itself \naccording to how strong, impatient, or eager it is, indiscriminately, \nas a gross appetite, and accepts whatever may be shouted in its ear \nby whichever commander (parents, teachers, laws, class prejudices, \npublic opinions). Human development has been so strangely \nrestricted—so laggardly, protracted, often regressing and turning \nround and round—because the herd instinct of obedience is \ninherited best, and at the cost of the skill in commanding. If we \nimagine this instinct taken to its ultimate excesses, we find a com- \nplete absence of commanders or independent people; or else they \nsuffer inwardly from a bad conscience and feel the need to dupe \nthemselves first in order to be able to give commands, by acting as \nif they too were only following orders. This really is the case in \n\n\nEurope today: I call it the moral hypocrisy of commanders.

Assuming that here, \ntoo, there are already small ongoing acts of consideration, sympathy, \nfairness, gentleness, reciprocal help; and that at this stage of society, \ntoo, all the instincts are already at work that will later be designated \nby honourable names as ‘virtues’ and finally fit the concept ‘moral- \nity’; during this period they are still in no way part of the realm \nof moral value judgements—they are still extra-moral. In the \nheyday of Rome for example, an act of pity was neither good nor \nevil, neither moral nor immoral; and even such praise as it may \nhave received could well be accompanied by a kind of irritated \ndisdain as soon as it was compared to an action that served to \nfurther the whole, the res publica.* Ultimately, ‘neighbourly love’ is \nalways something secondary, in part convention and a deliberate \nfiction in relation to fear of one’s neighbour. Once the social structure \nappears to be more or less established and secured against external \ndangers, it is this fear of one’s neighbour that once again creates \nnew perspectives for moral value judgements. Certain strong and \ndangerous instincts, such as adventurousness, recklessness, venge- \nfulness, slyness, rapacity, lust for power, were previously not only \nhonoured (by names other than the ones above, of course) as \nbeneficial to the community, but they also had to be cultivated and \nbred, because people continually had need of them in their common \ndanger against common enemies. But now (when there are no \ndrainage channels for them) these same instincts are felt to be \ndoubly dangerous and are gradually stigmatized and slandered as \nimmoral. Now the opposite drives and tendencies gain moral \n\n\n88 Beyond Good and Evil \nrespect; step by step, the herd instinct draws its consequences. \nThe moral perspective now considers how harmful or harmless an \nopinion, an emotional state, a will, a talent is to the community, to \nequality: here again, fear is the mother of morality. When an \nindividual’s highest and strongest instincts break forth with a \npassion, driving him far above and beyond the average, beyond the \nlowlands of the herd conscience, the community’s self-regard is \ndestroyed as a result; its belief in itself, its backbone, so to speak, \nis shattered: and that is why people do well to stigmatize and slander \njust these instincts above all. Exalted, self-directed spirituality, a \nwill to solitude, even great powers of reason are felt as a danger; \neverything that raises an individual above the herd and causes his \nneighbour to fear him is henceforth called evil; a proper, modest, \nconforming, equalizing mentality, what is average on the scale of \ndesires gains a moral name and respect. Finally, when conditions \nare very peaccable, there is less and less opportunity or necessity \nfor educating one’s feelings to be stern and harsh; and then every \nkind of sternness, even in matters of justice, begins to trouble the \nconscience; a harsh, exalted nobility or individual responsibility is \nalmost considered offensive and awakens distrust, whereas ‘a lamb’, \nor better yet, ‘a sheep’ gains in esteem. There can come a point of \nsuch sickly morbidity and pampered indulgence in the history of a \nsociety that in all due seriousness it even takes the side of the one \nwho does it harm, the criminal. Punishing: society thinks there is \nsomething unfair about it—it certainly finds the idea of ‘punish- \nment’ and the ‘need to punish’ painful and frightening. ‘Isn’t it \nenough just to render him innocuous? Why do we have to punish \nhim too? Real punishment is awful!’—with this question the herd \nmorality, the morality of timidity, draws its final conclusion. \nAssuming that we could entirely abolish the danger, the grounds \nfor fear, then we would have abolished this morality as well: it would \nno longer be necessary, it mould deem itself no longer necessary! \nAnyone who examines the conscience of a present-day European \nwill have to extract from his thousand moral crannies and hiding \nplaces the same imperative, the imperative of herdlike timidity: ‘At \nsome point, we want there to be nothing more to be afraid of? \nAt some point—the will and the way to that point is what everyone \nin Europe today calls ‘progress’. \nTowards a Natural History of Morals 89"

Morality in Europe today is herd \nanimal morality—and thus, as we understand things, it is only one \nkind of human morality next to which, before which, after which \nmany others, and especially higher moralities, are or should be \npossible. But this morality defends itself with all its strength against \nsuch ‘possibilities’, against such ‘should be’s’. Stubbornly and \nrelentlessly it says, ‘I am Morality itself, and nothing else is!’ \nIndeed, with the help of a religion that played along with and \nflattered the most sublime desires of the herd animal, we have \nreached the point of finding an ever more visible expression of \nthis morality even in political and social structures: the democratic \nmovement is Christianity’s heir. But its tempo is still far too slow \nand sleepy for the overeager, for patients or addicts of this above- \nmentioned instinct, as we can tell from the increasingly frantic \nhowl, the ever more widely bared teeth of the anarchist dogs who \nnow roam the alleys of European culture. They appear to be in \nconflict with the peaceably industrious democrats or ideologues \nof revolution, and even more with the foolish philosophasts and \ngo Beyond Good and Evil \nbrotherhood enthusiasts who call themselves socialists and want a \n‘free society’; but in reality they are united with those others in \ntheir fundamental and instinctive enmity towards every form of \nsociety other than autonomous herds (right up to the point of even \nrejecting the concepts ‘master’ and ‘servant’—wni dieu ni maitre* is a \nsocialist motto); united in their tough resistance to every exceptional \n\n\nclaim, every exceptional right and privilege (and thus ultimately to \nall rights, for no one needs ‘rights’ any longer when everyone is \nequal); united in their distrust of any justice that punishes (as if it \nwere a rape of the weaker party, unjust towards the necessary conse- \nquence of all earlier society); but also just as united in their religion \nof pity, in their empathy, wherever there are feelings, lives, or \nsuffering (reaching down to the animal or up to ‘God’—the eccen- \ntric notion of ‘pity for God’ suits a democratic age); united one \nand all in their impatient cry for pity, in their mortal hatred of any \nsuffering,* in their almost feminine incapacity to remain a spectator \nto it, to allom suffering; united in the involuntary depression and \ndecadence which seems to hold Europe captive to a threatening \nnew Buddhism; united in their belief in a morality of communal \npity, as if it were Morality itself, the summit, the conquered summit \nof humankind, the only hope for the future, comfort in the present, \nthe great redemption from all past guilt—united together in their \nbelief in community as a redeemer, and thus a belief in the herd, a \nbelief in ‘themselves’ . . ."

      "text": "RUNNING the risk that moralizing, even my own, will prove to be \nwhat it always has been (an unabashed montrer ses plaies,* according \nto Balzac), I would like to try to argue against an unseemly and \nharmful hierarchical shift between science* and philosophy that is \nnow threatening to develop quite unnoticed and, it seems, in good \nconscience. In my opinion, a person’s right to speak about so \nelevated a question as hierarchy grows out of his experience (and \nexperience, I think, always means bad experience?), so that he is \nnot speaking about colour as the blind might do, or against science \nas women and artists might (‘Oh, this nasty old science!’ sighs their \ninstinct and their shame, ‘it’s always finding out about everything”). \nThe scientist’s Declaration of Independence, his emancipation from \nphilosophy, is one of the more subtle influences of the democratic \ndisposition (and indisposition): the scholar’s overweening self- \nglorification is in full bloom everywhere these days, in its finest \nspringtime—which is not yet to suggest that in this case self-praise \nsmells sweet.* ‘Down with all masters!’—that’s what the rabble \ninstinct is urging here too; and science, after its great success in \nwarding off theology, whose ‘handmaid’ it was for too long, is now \narrogantly and ignorantly intent on making laws for philosophy and \ntaking its own turn at playing the ‘master —what am I saying? the \nphilosopher. My memory (a scientific man’s memory, if you permit \nme to say so!) is bursting with naive remarks about philosophy and \nphilosophers that I have heard made by arrogant young natural \nscientists and old doctors (not to mention the most cultured and \nconceited* of scholars, the philologists and pedagogues, who are \nboth by profession). Now it was an idler or specialist who instinc- \ntively resisted any kind of synthethic ability or project; now a \ndiligent worker who had caught a whiff of otium* and elegant \nvoluptuousness in the philosopher’s inner economy and felt \n94 Beyond Good and Evil \ncompromised and diminished by it. Now it was the colour-blindness \nof a utilitarian who sces nothing in philosophy but a series of refuted \nsystems and a wasteful display that isn’t ‘good for’ anything. Now \nit was the fear of veiled mysticism and of newly defined limits to \nknowledge that leapt to the fore; and now a disdain for particular \nphilosophers, unwittingly generalized into disdain for philosophy \nin general. But most frequently I found that underlying the young \nscholars’ arrogant condescension towards philosophy was the bad \ninfluence of a philosopher himself, one whom they gencrally no \nlonger followed, it is true, but whose spell-binding dismissive \nassessments of other philosophers they had not shaken off—the \nresult then being complete annoyance with all philosophy. (It seems \nto me that Schopenhauer, for example, has had this kind of effect \n\n\non Germany most recently—with his unintelligent wrath towards \nHegel he has succeeded in wrenching a whole generation of young \nGermans out of their relation to German culture, a culture which, \nweighing everything carefully, represented a supreme divinatory \nrefinement of the /istorica/ sense: but in just this area Schopenhauer \nhimself was almost brilliantly wanting, unreceptive, un-German.) \nIn general and on the whole, it may well have been the human, all- \ntoo-human quality of recent philosophy, its poverty in short, that \nhas most thoroughly hampered any possible respect for philosophy \nand opened the gates for the rabble instinct. Let us admit to \nourselves how greatly our modern world lacks the whole strain of \nmen like Heraclitus, Plato, Empedocles, and all the other splendid, \nroyal hermits of the spirit; and given such representatives of philo- \nsophy as the ones whom today’s fashion has set at the top of \nthe heap—and beneath respect—(like the two lions of Berlin, the \nanarchist Eugen Dühring* and the amalgamist Eduard von Hart- \nmann* in Germany), how entitled an honest man of science is to \nfeel that he is of a better strain and parentage. The sight of those \nhodgepodge philosophers who call themselves ‘reality philosophers’ \nor ‘positivists’ is especially capable of inspiring an ambitious young \nscholar’s heart with dangerous distrust: at best, these people are \nscholars and specialists themselves, it is clear as day! Indeed, they \nare all of them people who have been overcome and retrieved by \nthe dominion of science; at one time or another they wanted \nmore of themselves, but they had no right to this ‘more’ and its \nresponsibility, and now they represent in word and deed, honour- \nWe Scholars 95 \nably, fiercely, vengefully, a disbelief in the masters’ task and the \nmasterfulness of philosophy. And in the end—how could it be \notherwise! Science is abloom these days, its good conscience shining \nfrom its face, while recent philosophy has gradually sunk to its \ndregs, awakening distrust and despondence if not scorn and pity. \nPhilosophy reduced to a ‘theory of cognition’, really no more than \na shy epochism and doctrine of renunciation; a philosophy that \ndoesn’t even get beyond the threshold, scrupulously refusing itself \nthe right to enter: this is philosophy at its last gasp, an end, an \nagony, something to evoke pity. How could a philosophy like that— \nbe the master!"

The towers of knowledge have grown to enormous size, \n\n\nand with them the probability that a philosopher will tire even while \nstill a learner or will come to a halt somewhere and ‘specialize’, so \nthat he never arrives at his peak, that is, a grand survey, a panorama, \na view downwards. Or he will reach the top too late, when his best \nperiod and powers are behind him; or so impaired, coarsened, and \ndegenerated that his view, his overall value judgement no longer \nmeans very much. It is the very subtlety of his intellectual con- \nscience that might make him linger or hesitate on his path. He \nfears the seduction of becoming a dilettante, a SCENTipede;* he \nknows only too well that a man who has lost his self-respect can \nno longer command, no longer /ead in the search for knowledge, \neither: otherwise he would have to want to become a great actor, a \nphilosophical Cagliostro* and pied piper of minds—in short, \na seducer. This is finally a question of taste, even if it weren’t a \nquestion of conscience. In addition, redoubling the philosopher’s \ndifficulty yet again, he demands of himself a judgement, a Yes or \nNo, not about the sciences, but about life and the value of life; \nreluctantly, he learns to believe in his right or even duty to make \nsuch judgements, and that only on the basis of the most wide- \nranging (perhaps most disruptive, destructive) experiences will he \nfind his way—often hesitating, doubting, growing mute—to that \nbelief and that right. For a long time now, in fact, the crowd has \n96 Beyond Good and Evil \nmistaken and misconstrued the philosopher, whether taking him to \nbe a man of learning and ideal scholar, or God’s religiously exalted, \ndesensualized, ‘desecularized’ enthusiast and drunkard; and these \ndays if we hear someone praised for living ‘wisely’ or ‘like a \nphilosopher’, it almost always means no more than ‘prudently and \napart’. Wisdom: to the rabble it appears to be a form of escape, a \ntricky way to make a good exit from a wicked game; but the true \nphilosopher (isn’t that how me see it, my friends?) lives ‘unphilo- \nsophically’ and ‘unwisely’ and above all imprudently and feels the \nburdensome duty of a hundred tests and temptations in life—he is \ncontinually risking Avmse/f, he plays that wicked game..."

Indeed, as compensation we concede both \nof them, scholars and old maids, respectability (we make a point \nof respectability in such cases)—and we feel the same tinge of \n\n\nirritation at being obliged to concede it. Let’s look at this more \ncarefully: what is a man of learning? A common sort of man, first \nof all, with a common man’s virtues, that is to say, neither masterful \nnor authoritative nor even self-sufficient. He is industrious, \npatiently joining the rank and file, conforming and moderate in his \nabilities and needs. He has an instinct for his own kind and for \nwhat his own kind requires—that little patch of independence and \ngreen meadow, for example, that enables him to work in peace; that \nclaim to honour and appreciation (which first of all and above all \nassumes that he is recognized, recognizable);* that sunshine of a \ngood name; that enduring seal upon his value and his usefulness \nthat must continually overcome the inner mistrustfulness at the \nheart’s core of all dependent people and herd animals. A scholar \nalso has the illnesses and bad habits of the common sort, of course: \nhe is rich in petty envy and has a lynx-eye for what is base in those \nother natures whose heights he is unable to reach. He is friendly, \nalthough only like someone who lets himself go, but not stream \nforth; and it is precisely when facing a man who is a broad \nWe Scholars 97 \nstream that he holds himself so cold and closed—then his eye is \nlike a glassy, impenetrable lake, no longer rippled by delight or \nempathy. The worst and most dangerous things that a scholar is \ncapable of come from the instinct of his type to mediocrity, that \nJesuitical mediocrity that works instinctively to destroy the extra- \nordinary man and tries to break or—even better!—to loosen every \ntensed bow.

      "text": "However gratefully we may hail the objective spirit (and who has \nnot at times been sick to death of all subjectivity with its damned \nipseity!),* we must finally also learn to be cautious about our \ngratitude and put a stop to the exaggerated way in which intellectual \nselflessness and depersonalization have been praised lately as if they \nwere an end in themselves, redeeming and transfiguring. This has \ntended to happen among the school of pessimists especially, who \nfor their part do have good reasons to pay the highest honour to \n‘disinterested cognition’. The objective person, one who no longer \ncurses and scolds like the pessimist, the idea/ scholar in whom \nthe scientific instinct blossoms fully and finally after thousands of \ncomplete or partial false starts, is certainly one of the most precious \n\n\ntools that exist: but he needs to be put into the hand of someone \nmore powerful. He is only a tool; let’s say that he is a mirror, not \nan ‘end unto himself’. The objective man is indeed a mirror: above \nall, we must admit, he is accustomed to subjugating himself, with \nno desire other than what knowledge, what ‘reflecting’ can offer \nhim. He waits until something comes along and then spreads \nhimself out gently so that even the light footsteps of spirit-like \nbeings gliding by will not be lost upon his surface and skin. What \nstill adheres to him of a ‘person’ he considers accidental, often \narbitrary, more often annoying, so completely has he come to see \nhimself as a passageway or reflection of distant figures and events. \nHe remembers about ‘himself’ with effort and often incorrectly; \nhe easily mistakes himself for someone else; he attends poorly to \nhis own needs, and only in this regard can he be coarse and \n98 Beyond Good and Evil \nnegligent. He might suffer from bad health or from the pettiness \nand stuffy air of wife and friends or from a lack of comrades and \ncompany—oh, he will force himself to meditate on this suffering, \nbut in vain! His thinking is already wandering off to the more \ngeneral case, and by tomorrow he will know as little as he did \nyesterday about what might help him. He does not take himself \nseriously, does not take the time: he is cheerful not from a lack of \ndistress, but from a lack of fingers and handles to grasp Ats distress. \nHis typical openness towards all things and experiences, the sunny, \nunrestrained hospitality with which he welcomes everything that \ncomes his way, his manner of reckless benevolence, of dangerous \nunconcern about Yes and No—oh, there are certainly many times \nwhen he must atone for these, his virtues! And as a human being \nhe all too easily becomes their caput mortuum.* If someone expects \nlove or hatred of him (and I mean love and hatred as God, women, \nand animals understand them), he will do what he can and give \nwhat he can. But no one should be surprised if this is not much, \nif it is just here that he turns out to be false, brittle, dubious, and \nrotten. His love is forced, his hatred artificial and more of a tour \nde force, a little show of vanity and exaggeration. For he is genuine \nonly as long as he may be objective: only in his cheerful totalism \nis he still ‘nature’ and ‘natural’. His mirroring soul, ever smoothing \nitself out, no longer knows how to affirm, no longer how to deny; \nhe does not command, neither does he destroy. ‘Je ne méprise \npresque rien’,* he says with Leibniz, and we should not ignore or \nunderestimate that ‘presque’! Nor is he a model human being; he \nneither precedes nor follows anyone; in general he puts himself at \nsuch a distance that he has no grounds on which to take a side \nbetween good and evil. If we have for so long mistaken him for a \nphilosopher, for a dictatorial breeder and tyrant of culture, we have \ndone him far too great an honour and overlooked the most essential \n\n\nthing about him: he is a tool, a slave-like entity, if certainly the \nmost sublime sort of slave, but in himself nothing—presque rien! \nThe objective man is a tool, a precious, easily injured and demoral- \nized measuring tool and artful mirror to be preserved and \nhonoured; but he is not a goal, not a way out or up, not a com- \nplementary person in whom the rest of existence is justified, not a \nconclusion—and even less a beginning, a begetting or first cause, \nnothing tough, powerful, autonomous that wants to be the master: \nWe Scholars 99 \nbut rather only a delicate, empty, thin, malleable vessel of forms \nthat must first wait for some sort of content and substance in order \nto ‘take shape’ accordingly—usually a person without substance or \ncontent,* a ‘selfless’ person.

      "text": "When a philosopher today asserts that he is no sceptic (I hope this \nwas clearly understood in the description of the objective spirit \noffered above?) no one is happy to hear it. People look at him rather \nfearfully for tell-tale signs; they would like to ask him, ask him so \nmuch ... in fact, timid listeners (who are plentiful nowadays) con- \nclude that he is dangerous. When he rejects scepticism, they seem \nto hear some far-off ominous sound, as if a new explosive were \nbeing tested somewhere, intellectual dynamite, perhaps a newly \ndiscovered Russian nihilism,* a pessimism bonae voluntatis* that \ndoes not merely say No, or will No, but—terrible thought!—acts \nNo. Against that kind of ‘good will’ (a will to deny life truly, \nactively) there is admittedly no better sedative or tranquillizer today \nthan scepticism, the dear, gentle, lulling opium of scepticism; and \nnowadays even Hamlet is given prescriptions by doctors of the age \nto ward off the ‘spirit’? and its underground rumbling. ‘Aren’t our \nears filled with enough bad noises already?’ asks the sceptic, as a \nfriend of peace and almost as a kind of security police, ‘this subter- \nranean “No” is terrible! Would you please be quiet, you pessimistic \nmoles!’ The sceptic, you see, that delicate creature, is all too easily \nstartled; his conscience has been trained to twitch and feel some- \nthing like a pang at every ‘No’ and even at a decisive, harsh ‘Yes’. \nYes! and No!—that goes against his morality. Conversely, he loves \nto indulge his virtue with noble abstinence, as if to say with Mon- \ntaigne, ‘What do I know?’* Or with Socrates, ‘I know that I know \nnothing.’ Or, ‘I wouldn’t venture in here, no door is open to me.’ \nOr, ‘Even if the door were open, why should I go right in!’ Or, \n‘What use are premature hypotheses? It might be in better taste to \n\n\nmake no hypotheses at all. Must you always take something crooked \nand hurry to bend it straight? Always plug up every hole with some \nsort of wadding? Don’t we have plenty of time? Doesn’t time \nhave plenty of time? Oh you daredevils, can’t you just wait? Even \n100 Beyond Good and Evil \nuncertainty has its charms; even the Sphinx is a Circe; even Circe \nwas a philosopher.’ \nThat is how a sceptic comforts himself; and it is true that he \nhas need of some comfort. For scepticism is the most spiritual \nexpression of a certain complex physiological condition that in \ncommon parlance is called bad nerves or sickliness; it invariably \npresents itself whenever races or classes that have long been kept \napart intermix significantly and suddenly. Because the new gener- \nation has, as it were, inherited blood in new proportions and values, \neverything is restless, agitated, doubtful, experimental. The best \nenergies have an inhibiting effect; even the virtues do not allow \none another to grow or prosper; body and soul lack balance, gravity, \nperpendicular sureness. But what is prone most of all to illness \nand degeneracy in these mixed breeds is the mi//: they no longer \nunderstand how to make an independent decision or to feel the \nbrave pleasure of willing—even in their dreams they doubt the \n‘freedom of the will’. Our Europe of today, the scene of a ridicu- \nlously sudden experiment in the radical mixture of classes and \ntherefore of races, is as a consequence thoroughly sceptical—some- \ntimes with that agile scepticism that springs impatiently and \ndesirously from branch to branch, sometimes sad like a rain cloud \nladen down with question marks: and often sick unto death of its \nwill! Paralysis of the will: where don’t you stumble across this \ncripple these days! And often how very dolled up! Dressed to kill! \nThis illness comes clothed in the prettiest finery and falsehoods; \nand that what is displayed in shop windows these days as ‘object- \nivity’, ‘scientific method’, ‘lart pour lart * ‘pure, will-free \nknowledge’ is usually only decked-out scepticism and paralysis of \nthe will—I will vouch for this diagnosis of the European disease. \nThe disease of the will has spread over Europe unevenly: it is \nmost pronounced and most multifarious where culture has been \ndomesticated longest; it disappears according to how much the \n‘barbarian’ still (or once again) holds sway underneath the ill-fitting \ngarments of occidental culture. In contemporary France, then, as \nwe can so easily deduce and observe, the will is sickest of all. France \nhas always mastered the skill of reversing even its disastrous turns \nof spirit into something charming and seductive, and by teaching \nand displaying all the glamour of scepticism it most clearly demon- \nstrates its cultural dominance over Europe today. The strength to \n\n\nWe Scholars IOI \nwill, or to persist in wanting a will, is rather stronger in Germany, \nand in northern Germany stronger still than in central Germany; \nnoticeably stronger in England, and in Spain and Corsica, related \nto phlegm in the former case, to hard heads in the latter (leaving \nout Italy, which is too young to know what it wants and must first \nprove whether it is capable of willing); but it is strongest and most \nastonishing in that enormous middle kingdom where Europe seems \nto merge with Asia again: in Russia. That is where the energy to \nwill has long been stored up in reserve; that is where the will \n(whether it is a will to denial or to affirmation is unclear) waits \nominously to be released, to borrow the physicists’ current catch- \nword. Wars in India and entanglements in Asia may not be the \nonly things necessary to relieve Europe of its greatest danger, but \nrather internal revolts, the empire’s splintering into tiny bodies and \nabove all the introduction of parliamentary idiocy, as well as the \nobligation of everyone to read the newspaper over breakfast. I say \nthis not because I wish it: the reverse would actually be more to \nmy liking. I am talking about an increase in the Russian threat so \ngreat that Europe would have to decide to become equally threat- \nening, that is, to make use of a new ruling caste in order to gain a \nmill, a terrible, long-lived will of its own that could set itself goals \nover millennia—so that the long-drawn-out comedy of its small- \nstate system and likewise the multiple wills of its dynasties and \ndemocracies would finally come to an end. The time for petty \npolitics is over: even by the next century, we will be battling for \nmastery over the earth—forced into politics on a grand scale."

That reso- \nlute lover of handsome, well-built grenadiers, who as King of \nPrussia* fathered a military and sceptical genius (and in so doing \nbrought into being that new type of German who has recently \nemerged triumphant), that dubious mad father of Frederick the \nGreat himself had a genius’s lucky grasp of one point: he knew \nwhat was lacking in Germany back then, and what deficiency was \n102 Beyond Good and Evil \n\n\na hundred times more worrying and urgent than, say, a deficiency \nin education or social graces—his antipathy towards the young \nFrederick came from the anxiety of a deep instinct. Men were \nlacking—and to his bitterest dismay, he suspected that his own son \nwas not enough of a man. He was wrong about that, but who in \nhis place would not have been wrong? He watched his son succumb \nto atheism, esprit,* the epicurean light-heartedness of witty French- \nmen; he saw that great bloodsucking spider Scepticism in the \nbackground. He suspected the incurable misery of a heart that is \nno longer harsh enough for evil or for good, a shattered will \nthat no longer commands, no longer knows hom to command. But \nmeanwhile a new, harsher, more dangerous sort of scepticism was \ngrowing in his son (who can say precisely Aom greatly it was encour- \naged by the father’s hatred and the icy melancholy of a will grown \nused to solitude?), a daring, manly scepticism that is most closely \nrelated to a genius for war and conquest and that first entered \nGermany in the form of the great Frederick. This scepticism is \ndisdainful and nevertheless attracts; it undermines and takes pos- \nsession; it withholds belief, but does not lose itself in the process; \nto the spirit it gives a dangerous freedom, but the heart it keeps \nsternly in line. It is the German form of scepticism, and as an \nongoing, spiritually heightened Frederickianism it has for a good \nwhile brought Europe under the dominion of the German spirit \nand its critical and historical mistrust. Thanks to the invincibly \nstrong, tough, manly character of the great German philologists \nand critics of history (all of whom, viewed correctly, were also \nperformers of destruction and dissolution) and despite all the \nRomanticism in music and philosophy, a new concept of the German \nspirit gradually established itself, showing a pronounced tendency \nto manly scepticism—whether as a fearless gaze, for example, or as \nthe stern courage of a dissecting hand, or as the tenacious will to \ndangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized North Pole \nexpeditions under desolate and dangerous skies. There is probably \ngood reason for warm-blooded, superficial, humanly humans to \ncross themselves when they encounter this particular spirit: cet \nesprit fataliste, ironique, méphistophélique* is what Michelet calls it, \nnot without a shudder. But if we want to appreciate how distinctive \nis this fear of the ‘manly’ German spirit that awakened Europe \nfrom its ‘dogmatic slumber’,* we may remember the earlier concept \nWe Scholars 103 \nthat had to be overcome along with it—and how it wasn’t too long \nago that a mannish woman* could with unbridled arrogance dare \nto recommend that Europe take an interest in the Germans as \ngentle, good-hearted, weak-willed and poetic fools. At last we may \nfully understand Napoleon’s astonishment upon first meeting \n\n\nGoethe: it reveals how the ‘German spirit’ had been regarded for \ncenturies. ‘Voila un homme!’* which was to say, ‘My word, this is \na man! And I was expecting only a German!’"

They would be every bit \nas justified in calling themselves critics; and surely they will be \nmen who experiment. By the name that I have dared to call them* \nI have already expressly underlined their acts of experimenting and \ntheir joy in experimenting: did I do this because these critics in \nbody and soul like to make use of experiments in new, perhaps \nextended, perhaps more dangerous senses? Will they, in their \npassion for knowledge, take their daring and painful experiments \nfarther than the soft and spoiled taste of a democratic century can \nsanction? \nThere can be no doubt that these coming men will be least \nable to forgo those important and not inconsiderable qualities that \ndistinguish the critic from the sceptic; I mean the certainty of \nstandards, the conscious use of a unified method, shrewd courage, \nindependence, and a capacity for self-reliance. Indeed, in private \nthey admit to a joy in saying No and in dissecting; they admit to \na certain cruel concentration that knows how to wield the knife \nsurely and subtly, even when the heart is bleeding. They will be \nharsher (and perhaps not always only towards themselves) than \nhumane people may wish. They will not get involved with ‘truth’ \njust for the sake of ‘liking’ it or so that it can ‘exalt’ or ‘inspire’ \nthem; rather, they will have only slight faith that it is actually truth \nthat elicits these emotional pleasures. They will smile, these stern \nspirits, should somebody say to them, ‘That thought exalts me: \nhow can it not be true?’ Or, ‘That work delights me: how can it \n104 Beyond Good and Evil \nnot be beautiful?’ Or, “That artist makes me greater: how can he not \nbe great?” They greet all such enthusiasm, idealism, femininity, \nhermaphroditism not only with a smile, but with a real disgust, \nand if anyone were to follow them right into their secret heart’s \nchamber, he would be hard put to discover there any intention of \nreconciling ‘Christian sentiment’ with ‘ancient taste’, let alone with \n‘modern parliamentarianism’ (a reconciliation that is said to occur \neven in the philosophers of our very insecure and thus very concili- \n\n\natory age). Critical discipline and such habits as lead to neatness \nand rigour in matters of the spirit: these philosophers of the future \nwill not only demand them of themselves, but might even make a \ndisplay of them as their type of adornment—nevertheless they will \nnot yet want to be called critics. They deem it no little insult to \nphilosophy to decree, as people nowadays like to do, that ‘Philo- \nsophy is criticism and critical science—and that is all it is!’ Although \nthis evaluation of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the \npositivists in France and Germany (and it may even have flattered \nthe heart and taste of Kant: just think of the titles of his major \nworks), our new philosophers will say nevertheless that critics are \nthe tools of the philosopher, and precisely because they are tools \nthey are a long way from being philosophers themselves! The great \nChinaman of Konigsberg,* too, was only a great critic."

The education \nof the true philosopher may require that he himself once pass \nthrough all the stages at which his servants, the learned workers of \nphilosophy, remain—must remain. Perhaps he even needs to have \nbeen a critic and a sceptic and a dogmatist and an historian, and \nin addition a poet and collector and traveller and puzzle-solver \nand moralist and seer and ‘free spirit’ and nearly all things, so that \nhe can traverse the range of human values and value-feelings and \nbe able to look with many kinds of eyes and consciences from the \nheights into every distance, from the depths into every height, from \nthe corners into every wide expanse.

      "text": "More and more, I tend to think that because the philosopher is \nnecessarily a man of tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, he has \nalways been and has had to be in conflict with his Today: in \nevery instance, Today’s ideal was his enemy. Until now, all these \nextraordinary furtherers of humankind who are called philosophers \n(and who themselves rarely felt like lovers of wisdom, but more \nlike disagreeable fools and dangerous question marks) have found \ntheir task, their difficult, unwanted, unrefusable task, but ultimately \nalso the greatness of their task, in being the bad conscience of their \nage. By taking a vivisecting knife to the breast of the virtues of \ntheir age, they revealed their own secret: their knowledge of a new \nhuman greatness, a new, untrodden path to human aggrandizement. \nTime and again they uncovered how much hypocrisy, smugness, \ncasual acquiescence,* how much falsehood was hidden under the \n106 Beyond Good and Evil \nbest-honoured examples of their contemporary morality, how much \nvirtue was obsolete; time and again they said, ‘We must go there, \nout there, where all of you today are least at home.’ Faced with a \nworld of ‘modern ideas’ that would like to confine everyone to \na corner and to a ‘speciality’, the philosopher (if philosophers could \nexist today) would be forced to find human greatness, the concept \nof ‘greatness’ precisely in man’s breadth and variety, in his whole- \nness in diversity: in fact, he would assign value and rank according \nto how many and how many sorts of things one person could bear, \ncould take upon himself, by how far a person could extend his \nresponsibility. These days, the spirit of the times and the virtue of \nthe times are weakening and diluting the will; nothing is so fashion- \nable as weakness of will. Thus it is precisely strength of will, \nharshness, and a capacity for lengthy decisions that are integral to \nthe philosopher’s ideal concept of ‘greatness’. This is as appropriate \n\n\nas was the opposite doctrine (the ideal of a stupid, renunciatory, \nsubmissive, selfless humanity) in an opposite period, one that, like \nthe sixteenth century, suffered from the pent-up energy of the will \nand from the wildest floods and tidal waves of selfishness. At the \ntime of Socrates, everyone’s instinct was weary, and conservative \nold Athenians let themselves go (‘for happiness’ as they claimed, \nfor pleasure as they behaved), still pronouncing the same splendid \nwords that their lives had long failed to justify. At that time, irony \nmay have been necessary for greatness of soul, that malicious, \nSocratic certainty of the old doctor and plebeian who cut mercilessly \ninto his own flesh, as he did into the flesh and heart of the ‘noble’, \nwith a gaze that said clearly enough, ‘Don’t dissemble in front of \nme! Here—we are equal!’ In Europe today, by contrast, it is only \nthe herd animal who is honoured and bestows honour; ‘equal rights’ \ncan all too easily be transformed into equality of wrong (I mean, \ninto a shared struggle against everything rare, strange, privileged, \nagainst the higher human, the higher soul, the higher duty, the \nhigher responsibility, the creative abundance of power and \nelegance). And so these days, being noble, wanting to be for oneself, \nmanaging to be different, standing alone and needing to live inde- \npendently are integral to the concept of ‘greatness’; and the \nphilosopher will reveal something of his own ideal when he asserts, \n“The greatest person should be the one who can be most lonely, \nmost hidden, most deviant, the man beyond good and evil, the \nWe Scholars 107 \nmaster of his virtues, abundantly rich in will. This is what greatness \nshould mean: the ability to be both multifarious and whole, both \nwide and full.’ And to ask it once again: nowadays, is—greatness \npossible?"

However, the fact that everyone \ntoday speaks about things they cannot have experienced is most \n(and most unfortunately) true about the philosopher and the con- \nditions for philosophy: only very few people are familiar with them, \ncan be familiar with them, and all popular opinions about them are \nfalse. Thus, for example, the truly philosophical coexistence of a \nbold, unrestrained spirituality, running at a presto, and an unerring \ndialectical rigour and necessity is unknown to the experience of \nmost thinkers and scholars; and so, if someone were to tell them \nabout it, they would find it unbelievable.

In the human being, creature and creator are united: the \nhuman being is matter, fragment, excess, clay, filth, nonsense, chaos; \nbut the human being is also creator, sculptor, hammer-hardness, \nobserver-divinity, and the Seventh Day—do you understand this \nopposition? Do you understand that your pity is for the ‘creature \nin the human being’, that which must be formed, broken, forged, \ntorn, burned, annealed, purified—that which necessarily has to \nsuffer and should suffer? And our pity—do you not understand \nwhom our reversed pity is intended for, when it resists your pity as \n\n\nthe worst of all possible self-indulgences and weaknesses? \nPity versus pity, then! \nBut to repeat, there are more important problems than all those \nconcerning pleasure and suffering and pity; and any philosophy \nthat confines itself only to these is naive."

It is very important \nthat as few people as possible reflect on morality—and thus it is \nvery important that morality should never become interesting! But \nnot to worry! Things are the same today as they have always been: \nI can see no one in Europe who might entertain (or represent) the \nidea that moral reflection could be carried out in a dangerous, \ninsidious, or seductive fashion—that it might involve one’s fate! \nJust consider, for example, the inexhaustible, inevitable English \nutilitarians, how they amble along so awkwardly and worthily in \nBentham’s* footsteps (a Homeric simile says it more plainly),* just \nas he himself had already ambled in the worthy Helvétius’s* foot- \nsteps (no, he was not a dangerous man, this Helvétius!). No new \nthought, no attempt to give an old thought any kind of subtle turn \nor wrinkle, not even a real history of earlier thoughts: an impossible \nbody of literature on the whole, assuming one does not know how \nto pickle it with a bit of malice. For even these moralists (whom \nyou absolutely must read with mental reservations, if you must read \nthem) have been invaded by that old English vice called cant,* \nwhich is moral hypocrisy, this time hiding under the new form of \nscientific thinking. Nor is there a lack of secret defences against \nthe pangs of conscience that will necessarily torment a race of \nformer Puritans, whatever their scientific engagement with morality. \n(Isn’t a moralist the opposite of a Puritan, in that he is a thinker \n\n\nwho takes morality to be questionable, worthy of a question mark, \nin short, a problem? Mightn’t moralizing—be immoral?) Ultimately \nall of them want to justify English morality, in so far as that is the \nbest way to serve humanity or ‘the common good’ or ‘the happiness \nof the greatest number’—but no! the happiness of England. With \nall their might they would like to prove to themselves that the \nstriving for English happiness, which is to say for comfort and \nfashion* (and, above all, a seat in parliament) is also the right way \nto virtue—indeed that whatever virtue has existed in the world has \nconsisted in just this kind of striving. None of all these ponderous \nherd animals with a troubled conscience (who undertake to repre- \nsent the cause of egoism as a cause of the common good) wants to \nunderstand or nose out that the ‘common good’ is no ideal, no \ngoal, no concept that can somehow be grasped, but rather an \n120 Beyond Good and Evil \nemetic—that what is right for the one may certainly not be right \nfor the other, that to demand one morality for all is precisely to \nencroach upon the higher sort of human beings—in short, that \nthere is a hierarchy between human and human, and therefore \nbetween morality and morality as well. hey are modest and \nthoroughly mediocre kinds of men, these utilitarian Englishmen, \nand to repeat: in so far as they are boring, one cannot praise their \nutility too highly.

Perhaps I am risking something \n\n\nby letting a truth like that escape me: let others round it up again \nand give it enough to drink of the ‘milk of pious thinking’* so that \nit lies down again quiet and forgotten in its old corner. \nPeople should learn to understand cruelty differently and open \ntheir eyes; people should finally learn to be impatient, so that \npresumptuous, fat errors no longer wander about, virtuous and \ncheeky, like the errors concerning tragedy, for example, that have \nbeen fattened up by old and new philosophers. Almost everything \nthat we call ‘high culture’ is based on the deepening and spiritual- \nizing of cruelty—this is my tenet. That ‘wild beast’ has not been \nkilled off at all, it lives and thrives, it has only—made a divinity of \nitself. It is cruelty that constitutes the painful voluptuousness \nof tragedy; whatever pleasing effect is to be found in so-called \ntragic pity or in anything sublime in fact, right up to the highest \nand most delicate shivers of metaphysics, gets its sweetness solely \nOur Virtues 121 \nbecause it is blended with the ingredient of cruelty. What the \nRoman in his arena, the Christian in his raptures before the cross, \nthe Spaniard confronting the stake or the bullfight, the Japanese of \ntoday who rushes to see tragic theatre, the working-class Parisian \nwho is nostalgic for bloody revolutions, the female Wagnerian who \nlets Tristan und Isolde wash over her with her will exposed—what \nall these people are enjoying, what they aspire to drink in with \nmysterious ardour is the spiced brew of the great Circe ‘Cruelty’. \nOf course, we have to get rid of that foolish psychology of earlier \ntimes that held that cruelty arises only at the sight of another \nperson’s suffering: there is also abundant, over-abundant pleasure \nin our own suffering, in making ourselves suffer. And wherever a \nperson can be persuaded to deny himself in a religious sense, or to \nmutilate himself in the manner of Phoenicians and ascetics, or in \ngeneral to become contrite, desensualized, decorporealized, to feel \nthe puritan spasm of penitence, to dissect the conscience and make \na Pascalian sacrifizio dell’intelletto,* he is covertly being tempted \nand urged forward by his cruelty, by that dangerous shiver of \ncruelty turned against himself. Finally, let us consider that even the \nman who seeks knowledge, by forcing his spirit to know things \ncontrary to the inclination of his mind and often enough also con- \ntrary to the wishes of his heart (that is, saying No where he would \nlike to say Yes, where he would like to love and adore) functions as \nan artist and transfigurer of cruelty; whenever we take on anything \ndeeply and thoroughly, it is already a rape, a wanting to do harm \nto the fundamental will of the spirit, a will that is constantly \ndrawn to appearances and surfaces—in every desire for knowledge \nthere is already a drop of cruelty."

      "text": "Perhaps what I have said about a ‘fundamental will of the spirit’ \nwill not be immediately transparent: permit me to explain. \nThat imperious something that the common people call ‘spirit’ \nwants to be the master, in itself and around itself, and to feel its \nmastery: it has the will to go from multiplicity to simplicity, a will \nthat binds together, subdues, a tyrannical and truly masterful \nwill. In this regard, its needs and capacities are the same as those \nthe physiologists claim for everything that lives, grows, and repro- \n122 Beyond Good and Evil \nduces. The spirit’s energy in appropriating what is foreign to it is \nrevealed by its strong tendency to make the new resemble the old, \nto simplify multiplicity, to overlook or reject whatever is completely \ncontradictory; the spirit likewise arbitrarily underlines, emphasizes, \nor distorts certain qualities and contours in everything that is \nforeign to it or of the ‘outer world’. Its intention in doing so is to \nincorporate new ‘experiences’, to fit new things into old orders— \nto grow, then; and more specifically, to feel growth, to feel an \nincrease in strength. This same will is served by an apparently \nopposite instinct of the spirit: a sudden decision for ignorance, for \narbitrary conclusions, a closing of the shutters, inwardly saying No \nto this thing or that, a refusal to let things draw near, a kind of \ndefensive posture against much potential knowledge, being content \nwith darkness, with a limited horizon, saying Yes to ignorance and \naffirming it; all this activity is necessary according to the degree of \nthe spirit’s appropriating energy, its digestive energy, to keep to the \nsame metaphor—and indeed the ‘spirit’ really resembles nothing \nso much as a stomach. \nLikewise relevant here is the spirit’s occasional will to allow itself \nto be deceived, accompanied perhaps by the mischievous intuition \nthat things are not this way or that, that we are just allowing \nthem to be taken this way or that; a joy in every uncertainty and \nambivalence; an exulting self-satisfaction in the arbitrary confine- \nment and privacy of a nook, in things that are all too close, in \nforeground things, in what has been enlarged, reduced, slanted, \nprettified; a self-satisfaction in the arbitrariness of all these \nexpressions of power. Also relevant here, finally, is the spirit’s not \ninconsiderable readiness to deceive other spirits and go among them \nin disguises, that constant pressure and stress of a creating, shaping, \ntransforming energy; it enables the spirit to enjoy its multiple masks \nand slynesses, and also its feeling of security—its Protean arts are \n\n\njust what defend and hide it best! \nThis will to appearance, to simplification, to masks, to cloaks, in \nshort, to the surface (for every surface is a cloak) is countered by \nthe sublime tendency of the man in search of knowledge to take \nand to want to take things deeply, multifariously, profoundly, as a \nkind of cruelty of intellectual conscience and aesthetic taste that \nevery courageous thinker will recognize in himself, if he has spent \nan appropriate amount of time in tempering and sharpening his \nOur Virtues 123 \nself-critical eye and if he is accustomed both to severe discipline \nand to severe words. He will say, ‘There is something cruel in the \npropensity of my spirit’—let virtuous and amiable people try to \ntalk him out of it! In truth, it would sound nicer if people could talk \nabout us, whisper about us, praise us (the free, very free spirits) \nfor ‘excessive honesty’, say, instead of for cruelty. And might that \nreally be what they will praise us for—when we are dead? Mean- \nwhile (for there is still time until then) there is probably no one as \ndisinclined as we to deck ourselves out in such spangled, sparkly \nmoral language: all our previous work has soured us to the cheerful \npomposity of just this kind of taste. They are beautiful, glittering, \njingling, festive words: honesty, love of truth, love of wisdom, \nsacrifice for knowledge, the heroism of truthfulness—there is some- \nthing about them that makes one swell with pride. But we hermits \nand marmots, we have long ago convinced ourselves in all the \nprivacy of our hermit’s conscience, that even this worthy linguistic \nostentation belongs with the old adornments, the mendacious trash \nand gold dust of unconscious human vanity, and that even under \nthis kind of flattering paint and concealing gilt the horrible original \ntext homo natura* must still be glimpsed. For to return man to \nnature; to master the many conceited and gushing interpretations \nand secondary meanings that have heretofore been scribbled and \npainted over that eternal original text homo natura; to ensure that \nhenceforth man faces man in the same way that currently, grown \ntough within the discipline of science, he faces the other nature, \nwith unfrightened Oedipus-eyes and plugged Odysseus-ears, deaf \nto the seductive melodies of the old metaphysical birdcatchers who \nhave too long been piping at him, ‘You are more! You are greater! \nYou are of a different origin!—that may be a strange and crazy \nproject, but it is a project—who could deny that! Why have we \nchosen it, this crazy project? Or to ask it another way, ‘Why bother \nwith knowledge?’ \nEveryone will ask us about it.

They want more; they are \nlearning to make demands; they end by considering that modicum \nof respect almost irritating, preferring to compete, or even to battle \nfor their rights: let’s just say women are becoming shameless. And \nlet us add at once that they are also becoming tasteless. They are \nforgetting how to fear men—but a woman who ‘forgets how to fear’ \nis abandoning her most womanly instincts. It is fair enough, even \nunderstandable enough if women dare to assert themselves when \nthe fear-inducing element in men (let’s put it more definitively: \nwhen the man in men) is no longer desired or cultivated; what \nis harder to understand is that this is enough to result in—the \ndegeneration of women. This is happening today; let’s make no \nmistake about it! Wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over \nthe military or aristocratic spirit, women are striving for the eco- \nnomic and legal independence of office clerks: ‘Women as clerks’ \nis written over the entrance-way to our developing modern society. \nWhile they are gaining these new rights, aiming to become ‘master’, \nand writing about women’s ‘progress’ on their flags and banners, \nit is terribly clear that the opposite is happening: momen are \nregressing. Ever since the French Revolution, women’s influence in \nEurope has decreased to the same extent that their rights and \nambitions have increased; and thus the ‘emancipation of women’, \nin so far as women themselves (and not only shallow males) are \ndemanding and encouraging it, turns out to be a curious symptom \nof increasing weakness and dullness in the most womanly instincts. \nThere is stupidity in this movement, an almost masculine stupidity, \nwhich a truly womanly woman (who is always a clever woman) \nwould have to be utterly ashamed of. To lose the scent for which \nbattleground best leads to victory; to neglect the practice of her \ntrue defensive arts; to let herself go ahead of a man, perhaps even \nOur Virtues 129 \n\n\n‘up to a book’, where she had earlier been well behaved and subtly, \ncleverly humble; to work with virtuous audacity against man’s belief \nin a fundamentally alien ideal, cloaked in the shape of woman, in \nsome Eternal- and Necessary-Feminine; to disabuse men volubly \nand emphatically of the notion that women should be kept, provided \nfor, protected, indulged like delicate, strangely wild, and often \npleasant domestic animals; to gather indignantly painstaking evi- \ndence of everything about the position of women in our own and \nearlier social orders that suggested the slave or bondman (as if \nslavery were a counter-argument and not rather a condition for \nevery higher culture, every heightening of culture)—what does all \nthis mean, if not a disintegration of womanly instincts, a defeminiz- \nation? To be sure, there are enough idiotic women-lovers and \nfemale-corrupters among scholarly asses of the male gender who \nare advising women to defemininize themselves in this way and to \nimitate all the stupidities that are infecting ‘men’ in Europe, Euro- \npean ‘masculinity’—those who would like to bring woman down to \nthe level of ‘general education’, or even to reading the newspaper \nand politicking. Some of them would even like to make women \ninto freethinkers and literati, as if a woman without piety were not \nsomething wholly repellent or ludicrous for a deep and godless \nman. Women’s nerves are being destroyed almost everywhere by \nthe most pathological and dangerous kinds of music (our modern \nGerman music), making women every day more hysterical and less \ncompetent for their first and last profession, the bearing of healthy \nchildren.

What \nflowing energies, what seasons and climates are intermingled here! \nNow it strikes us as archaic, now foreign, tart, and overly green; it \nis both arbitrary and stiffly traditional; often mischievous, more \noften blunt and crude—it has courage and fire and at the same \ntime the slack, faded skin of fruits that ripen too late. It streams \nforth wide and full: and then suddenly there is a moment of \ninexplicable hesitation, a kind of gap that springs up between cause \nand effect, a pressure that makes us dream, almost a nightmare*— \nbut then the old stream rolls on expansively again, exuding content- \nment, the most various contentment, past and present happiness, \nvery much including the artist’s happiness with himself, which he \nhas no interest in concealing, his astonished, happily shared know- \nledge that he is master of the techniques he is employing, his new, \nnew-won, untried artistic techniques as they seem to be revealed \nto us. Nothing beautiful, on balance, nothing of the South, nothing \nof the fine, bright, southern sky, nothing of gracefulness, no \ndancing, scarcely a will to logic; a certain clumsiness, in fact, which \nthe artist even stresses as if he wanted to tell us, “This is intentional’; \na ponderous draping, something arbitrarily barbaric, ceremonious, a \nglittering of venerable and erudite jewels and laces; something \nGerman in the best and worst senses of the word, something multi- \nfarious, unformed, and inexhaustible in the German way; a certain \nGerman massiveness and abundance of soul that is not afraid to be \nhidden by the artful trappings of decadence—that may in fact need \nthem in order to feel truly at ease; an honest-to-goodness symbol \n132 Beyond Good and Evil \n\n\nof the German soul, young and at the same time out of date, overly \nrotten and yet overly rich with the future.

Spirits more lumbering than our \nown may take longer periods of time to complete what we limit to \nhours, what we exhaust within hours, some of them requiring six \nmonths, others half a lifetime, according to the speed and strength \nof their digestion and their ‘metabolism’.* Indeed, I could imagine \nthat even within our quick-moving Europe, some dull, sluggish \nraces might need half-centuries to overcome these atavistic attacks \nof fatherland-ism and attachment to the soil, and return to reason, \nthat is to say, to being ‘good Europeans’. And as I digress about \nthis possibility, I chance to overhear the conversation of two old \n‘patriots’ (both of them were apparently hard of hearing and there- \nfore spoke all the louder). \n‘That fellow* has about as much understanding and appreciation \nof philosophy as a peasant or a fraternity student,’ said one of \nthem, ‘he is still innocent.

What use \nis it that those of us who are more cautious and reserved are not \nyet ready to abandon our old belief that only a great thought can \nendow a deed or cause with greatness. Assuming that a politician \nwere to place his people in the situation of having to embark on \n“large-scale politics”, which they were by nature poorly inclined \nor prepared to do, requiring them to sacrifice their old and certain \nvirtues fer the sake of a new, dubious mediocrity—assuming a \npolitician were to sentence his people to “politicking” in general, \nPeoples and Fatherlands 133 \nalthough they used to have better things to do and think about and \ncould not at the bottom of their hearts rid themselves of a cautious \ndisdain for the restlessness, vacuousness, and noisy wrangling of \n\n\ntruly political peoples: assuming that such a politician would rouse \nthe sleeping passions and desires of his people, turn their previous \nshyness and pleasure as bystanders into a defect, their foreignness \nand secret infinitude into a sin, devalue in their eyes their dearest \ninclinations, reverse their conscience, make their spirit narrow, their \ntaste “national”—well then! Such a politician, one who would do all \nthis, whose people would have to atone for him forever afterwards, if \nthey had an afterwards, such a politician would be great?’ \n‘Certainly!’ the other old patriot answered him vehemently, \n‘otherwise he wouldn’t have been able to do it! Do you think it was \nmad to want that kind of thing? But maybe all greatness was mere \nmadness at first! \n‘A misuse of language!’ objected his partner loudly. ‘Strength! \nStrength! Strength and madness! Not greatness!’ \nThe two old men had obviously become heated by yelling their \n‘truths’ at one another in this fashion. But I, happy to be above \nand beyond them, reflected on how quickly a strong man will find \na stronger master, and also that spiritual shallowness in one people \nis balanced out by greater depth in another."

Europeans \nare coming to resemble one another more and more, and are more \nand more free of the conditions that would give rise to races \nconnected by climate and class. They are increasingly independent \nof any particular environment that might inscribe its identical \ndemands into their bodies and souls over the course of centuries— \nthat is to say, an essentially supernational and nomadic type of \nman is slowly emerging, one that is distinguished, physiologically \nspeaking, by having a maximum of adaptive skills and powers. This \n134 Beyond Good and Evil \nprocess of the evolving European, which can be delayed by great \nrelapses in tempo but may as a result very well grow with new \nforce and depth (like the Storm and Stress of ‘national feeling’ still \nraging even now, for example, or the recent emergence of \n\n\nAnarchism): this process probably ends with results that were least \nanticipated by its naive sponsors and apologists, the apostles of \n‘modern ideas’.

      "text": "There was a time when people were in the habit of distinguishing \nthe Germans as ‘deep’. Now, when the most successful example \nof the new Germanness craves honours of quite a different sort \nand may wish that deep things were more ‘dashing’, it may be \nPeoples and Fatherlands 135 \nalmost timely and patriotic to wonder whether we were deluding \nourselves about our earlier reputation; to wonder, in short, whether \nGerman depth may not be something fundamentally different and \nworse—and something, thank God, that we are about to succeed \nin eliminating. So let’s try to change our thinking about German \n\n\ndepth: all it requires is a little vivisection of the German soul. \nThe German soul is above all multifarious, having diverse \nsources, being more layered and pieced together than truly con- \nstructed—this is because of its origins. Any German bold enough \nto claim that ‘two souls reside, alas, within my breast’* would be \ngrossly abusing the truth or more correctly falling short of the \ntruth by many souls. As a people in whom there is a most tremen- \ndous mixture and mingling of the races, with a possible \npreponderance of the pre-Aryan element, as a ‘people of the middle’ \nin every sense, the Germans are more incomprehensible, vast, \ncontradictory, alien, incalculable, surprising, even frightening than \nare other peoples to themselves—they escape definition and for that \nreason alone are the despair of the French. It is characteristic of \nthe Germans that they can never exhaust the question ‘What is \nGerman?’ Kotzebue* surely knew his Germans well enough: ‘We \nhave been recognized’, they called out to him joyfully—yet Sand \nalso thought he knew them. Jean Paul* knew what he was doing \nwhen he furiously declared his opposition to Fichte’s mendacious, \nbut patriotic flatteries and exaggerations—yet it is probable that \nGoethe did not agree with Jean Paul about the Germans, even if \nhe thought he was right about Fichte. I wonder what Goethe really \nthought about the Germans? \nBut Goethe never commented clearly on so much that sur- \nrounded him, and throughout his life managed to keep a refined \nsilence: he probably had his good reasons. What is certain is that \nit was neither the ‘Wars of Liberation’ nor the French Revolution \nthat caused him to brighten up a bit: the event that made him \nrethink his Faust, indeed the whole ‘human’ problem, was the \nappearance of Napoleon. We have observations of Goethe’s, made \nas if he were speaking from a foreign country, which condemn with \nimpatient harshness those things that Germans count as a source \nof pride: at one point he defines the famous German Gemiit* as \n‘indulging one’s own and other people’s weaknesses’. Is he wrong \nabout that? It is characteristic of the Germans that people are rarely \n136 Beyond Good and Evil \ncompletely wrong about them. The German soul contains within \nit a maze of passageways; there are caverns in it, hiding places, \ncastle keeps; its disorder has much of the charm of the mysterious; \na German knows about the secret paths to chaos. And just as each \nthing loves its own image, so the German loves clouds and every- \nthing that is unclear, evolving, dusky, damp and ominous: whatever \nis uncertain, unformed, shifting, growing he feels as ‘deep’. The \nGerman himself is not, he is becoming, he ‘is developing’. Thus \n‘development’ is the brilliant, truly German discovery in the great \n\n\nrealm of philosophical formulae: a governing concept that, along \nwith German beer and German music, is working at Germanizing \nall of Europe. Foreigners remain attracted and transfixed at the \nriddles posed by the essential contradictions at the bottom of \nthe German soul (which Hegel put into a system and Richard \nWagner more recently put to music). ‘Good-natured and malicious’: \nthat kind of juxtaposition, nonsensical in relation to any other \npeople, is unfortunately all too often justified in Germany: just go \nto live for a while among the Swabians! ‘The ungainliness and social \ntastelessness of the German scholar are frighteningly compatible \nwith the airy boldness of his inner tightrope dance, which all the \ngods have already learned to fear. If you want to see the ‘German \nsoul’ demonstrated ad oculos,* just take a look at German taste, \nGerman arts and customs: what a boorish indifference to ‘taste’! See \nhow the noblest and the commonest things are juxtaposed! How \nmessy and rich this whole inner economy is! The German is \nweighed down by his soul; he is weighed down by everything that \nhe experiences. He has trouble digesting his events, he never has \n‘done’ with them; German depth is often merely a heavy, sluggish \n‘digestion’. And just as all chronic patients, all dyspeptics prefer \nto be comfortable, so the German loves to be ‘open’ and ‘upright’: \nhow comfortable it is to be open and upright! \nToday, this friendly, receptive, cards-on-the-table aspect of \nGerman honesty may be the most dangerous and most successful \ndisguise that the German has mastered: it is his true Mephisto- \nphelian art; it will ‘take him far’! The German lets himself go, \nlooks on with faithful, empty, blue German eyes—and presto! \nforeigners confuse him with his dressing gown!—That is to say, \nwhatever ‘German depth’ may be (might we even consent to laugh \nat it, just between ourselves?), we will do well to continue to honour \nPeoples and Fatherlands 137 \nits image and good name and not sell our old reputation as a deep \npeople too cheaply in exchange for Prussian ‘dash’ and Berlin wit \nand sand.* It is prudent for a people to be taken for, to allow itself \nto be taken for deep, for awkward, for good-natured, for honest, \nfor imprudent: it might even—be deep! And finally, we should do \nhonour to our name—it’s not for nothing that we are called the \n‘Teuton’ people, the ‘two-timing’ people.*"

Alas, this too \nwill pass, one day. But who can doubt that the understanding and \nsavouring of Beethoven will pass far sooner! For he was only the \nlast note in a transition or break in styles, and not, like Mozart, \nthe last note of a great, centuries-long European taste. Beethoven \nis the transitional product of an old, crumbling soul that is con- \nstantly breaking apart and an overly young future soul that is \nconstantly approaching; his music glows in that twilight of ever- \nlasting loss and everlasting, excessive hope—the same light that \nbathed Europe when it dreamed along with Rousseau, when it \ndanced around the Revolution’s tree of liberty and finally almost \nmade an idol of Napoleon. But now, how quickly this particular \nfeeling is fading, how difficult it is today even to know about \nthis feeling—how alien to our ear is the language of Rousseau, \nSchiller, Shelley, Byron, in all of whom together the same European \n-© destiny found its way to the Word that sang in Beethoven! \nThe German music that followed belongs to Romanticism, that \nis, to an historically speaking even shorter, more fleeting, more \nsuperficial movement than was that other great interlude, Europe’s \ntransition from Rousseau to Napoleon and to the emergence of \ndemocracy. Weber: but what do we care about Oberon or the Frei- \nschiitz today! Or Marschner’s Hans Heiling and Vampyr! Or even \nWagner’s Tannhäuser! This music has died away, even if it hasn’t \nyet been forgotten. Furthermore, all this Romantic music was not \n138 Beyond Good and Evil \nnoble enough, not music enough to maintain its legitimacy any- \nwhere but in the theatre and before the crowd; it was second-class \nmusic from the start and rarely came to the attention of real \nmusicians. Things were different with Felix Mendelssohn, that \nhalcyon master whose lighter, purer, more cheerful soul made him \nquickly celebrated and just as quickly forgotten—as a beautiful \nepisode in German music. But as for Robert Schumann, who took \neverything seriously and was also taken seriously from the start (he \nis the last composer to have founded a school): don’t we privately \nconsider it a stroke of luck, a relief, a liberation that this particular \nSchumannesque Romanticism has been overcome? Schumann, \nsecking refuge in the ‘Saxon Switzerland’* of his soul, half of him \nlike Werther,* half like Jean Paul, certainly not like Beethoven! \nCertainly not like Byron. (His Manfred music is a mistaken misun- \nderstanding to the point of injustice.) Schumann: with his \nessentially sall taste (a dangerous tendency, that is,—among \nGermans doubly dangerous—to quiet lyricism and intoxication of \n\n\nthe emotions), always walking apart, withdrawing and retreating \nshyly, a noble reed of a boy who revelled utterly in anonymous \nhappiness and sorrow, from the start a sort of a girl and noli \nme tangere:* this Schumann was already only a German musical \nphenomenon, not a European one as Beethoven was, as Mozart has \nbeen to an even greater extent—in him German music was \nthreatened by its greatest danger: to cease being the voice of Europe's \nsoul and to deteriorate into mere fatherland-ism."

When \nthe ancients read something (it did not happen too often), they \nwould read it aloud, in a loud voice, in fact; if a person read quietly \nto himself, people were surprised and wondered privately about his \nreasons. In a loud voice: that means with all the swelling, modula- \nting, shifting of tone and all the tempo changes that the ancient \npublic world enjoyed. At that time the laws of literary style were \nthe same as those of oratory; and these laws depended in part \non the astonishing training and subtle needs of ear and larynx, and \nin part on the strength, endurance, and power of ancient lungs. A \nperiodic sentence in the ancient sense is above all a physiological \nwhole, in so far as it is encompassed by one sole breath. A period \nin the manner of Demosthenes or Cicero, swelling twice and sinking \ntwice and all in the span of one breath: this is a pleasure for the \nancients, who had learned from their own training to appreciate \nthe virtue of such a sentence, how rare and difficult it is to enunciate \nit. We really have no right to the grand period, we moderns, in \nevery sense the short-winded! These ancients were themselves all \n140 Beyond Good and Evil \noratorical dilettantes, after all, and thus connoisscurs, and thus \ncritics—that is how they pushed their orators to the extremes. \nSimilarly, every Italian in the last century, male and female, knew \nhow to sing, and as a consequence vocal virtuosity (and thus also \nthe art of melody) reached a high point. In Germany, however (up \nuntil the most recent times, when a kind of grandstand eloquence \nhas been shyly and clumsily testing its wings), there was actually \nonly one form of public and more-or-less artistic oratory—and that \nis what was delivered down from the pulpit. Only the preachers in \nGermany knew what a syllable, what a word is worth, to what \ndegree a sentence can resound, leap, plunge, run along, run down; \nonly they had a conscience in their ears, and often enough a bad \nconscience: for there are plenty of reasons why Germans in par- \nticular achieve excellence in oratory only rarely and almost always \ntoo late. That is why the masterpiece of German prose is, appropri- \nately, the masterpiece of its greatest preacher: the Bible has been the \nbest German book so far. Compared to Luther’s Bible, practically \neverything else is only ‘belles lettres’—-a thing that was not grown \nin Germany and therefore did not and will not grow its way into \nGerman hearts, as the Bible has done."

With today’s Germans, for example, it is now \n\n\nthe anti-French stupidity, now the anti-Jewish, now the anti-Polish, \nnow the Christian-Romantic, now the Wagnerian, now the Teu- \ntonic, now the Prussian (just think of those pitiful historians, those \nSybels and Treitzschkes* with their heavily bandaged heads), and \nwhatever else they are called, these little becloudings of the German \nspirit and conscience. May I be forgiven that I too, during a short, \nhazardous stay in a very infected area, did not remain entirely \nspared by the disease and, like everyone, began to think about \nthings that were none of my business: the first sign of political \ninfection. About the Jews, for example: just listen. \nI have never yet met a German who might have been well \ndisposed to Jews; and however unconditionally all careful and \npolitical people may reject real anti-Semitism, even their care \nand politics are not really directed at the type of feeling per se, but \nrather at its dangerous extremes, especially if these extreme feelings \nare expressed reprehensibly or tastelessly—we must not deceive \n142 Beyond Good and Evil \nourselves about that. That Germany has more than enough Jews, \nthat German stomachs, German blood have found it difficult (and \nwill continue to find it difficult) to deal with even this amount of \n‘Jew’ (which the Italian, the Frenchman, the Englishman have dealt \nwith, thanks to their stronger digestions): a general instinct states \nthis in clear language, and we must listen to that instinct and act \naccordingly. ‘Do not allow any new Jews to enter! And bar especially \nthose doors that face Kast (and also towards Austria)? Thus decrees \nthe instinct of a people whose kind is still weak and inchoate, \nmaking it casily vulnerable to obliteration or elimination by a \nstronger race. But the Jews are without doubt the strongest, \ntoughest, and purest race now living in Europe; they know how to \nsucceed under even the worst conditions (better in fact than under \nfavourable ones) by means of certain virtues that we today would \nlike to label vices—they owe it above all to their resolute faith that \nhas no need to feel ashamed at ‘modern ideas’. They change, if \nthey change, only in the way the Russian Empire makes its con- \nquests: like an empire that takes its time and did not just develop \novernight— that is to say, according to the principle ‘As slowly as \npossible? Any thinker who has Europe’s future on his conscience \nmust in any proposal he makes about that future take the Jews into \naccount like the Russians, as they are obviously the surest and most \nlikely clements in the great game and struggle of forces. What we \nin Europe today call a ‘nation’ and what is actually more of a res \nfacta than nata (sometimes even easily confounded with a res ficta \net picta)* is certainly something evolving, young, easily displaced, \nnot yet a race, let alone the sort of aere perennius* that is the Jewish \nkind: these ‘nations’ should refrain from becoming the Jews’ hot- \n\n\nheaded enemies or competitors! If they wanted to (or if they were \nforced to it, as the anti-Semites seem to want them to be), the Jews \ncould gain the upper hand, could in fact quite literally rule over \nEurope, that much is clear—just as clear as the fact that they are \nnot planning or working towards that end. For the time being, what \nthey want and wish for, even with a certain urgency, is rather to \nbe wholly absorbed by Europe, into Europe; they yearn to be \nestablished, legitimate, respected somewhere at last, and to set an \nend to their nomadic life as ‘wandering Jews’. And we should heed \nand welcome this strong desire (that in itself may already express \na softening of Jewish instincts)—in that spirit it might be proper \nPeoples and Fatherlands 143 \nand useful to reprimand all the anti-Semitic loudmouths in the \nland. We should welcome them with great caution, with selectivity, \nmore or less as the English nobility does.

But what also offends us about the \nmost human Englishman is his lack of music, to speak metaphor- \nically (and non-metaphorically): in the movements of his body and \nsoul he has no tempo, no dance, not even a desire for tempo \nand dance, for ‘music’.

Indeed, who \nwould question that it is occasionally useful for these kinds of spirits \nto be dominant?

Its members keep themselves \nwell hidden—there may be only a small number of people in whom \nit is alive and well, nor are they necessarily the steadiest on their \nfeet, some of them fatalists, melancholics, invalids, some of them \nspoiled or affected, people whose ambition it is to remain hidden. \nAll of them have one thing in common: they keep their ears \nclosed to the raving stupidity and noisy chatter of the democratic \nbourgeoisie. To be sure, a France that is increasingly stupid and \ncoarse is thrashing around in the foreground—at Victor Hugo’s \nfuneral it recently held a veritable orgy of bad taste and simul- \n\n\ntaneous self-admiration. And there is something else they share: a \ngreat will to defend themselves against spiritual Germanization— \n146 Beyond Good and Evil \nand an even greater inability to do so! Schopenhauer may already \nhave become more at home, more indigenous in this spiritual France \n(which is also a pessimistic France) than he ever was in Germany. \nNot to mention Heinrich Heine, who long ago entered the flesh \nand blood of Paris’s finer and more ambitious poets; or Hegel, who \ntoday exercises an almost tyrannical influence in the figure of Taine* \n(the first living historian). But as far as Richard Wagner goes, we can \npredict that the more French musicians learn to shape themselves \naccording to the true needs of the dme moderne,* the more they \nwill ‘Wagnerize’—they’re already doing enough of it! \nNevertheless, there are still three things that the French can \npoint to with pride as their particular heritage and an abiding sign \nof their old cultural superiority over Europe, however much their \naesthetic taste has been voluntarily or involuntarily Germanized or \nvulgarized: first, the capacity for artistic passions, devotion to \n‘form’, for which the phrase L'art pour lart,* along with a thousand \nothers, was invented; for three hundred years France has never \nlacked these qualities; its respect for the ‘small number’ repeatedly \ngave rise to a kind of literary chamber music that is hard to find \nin the rest of Europe. \nThe second thing on which the French can base their superiority \nover Europe is their old, heterogeneous, moralistic culture, which \nenables one to find even in lightweight newspaper novelists or \nchance boulevardiers de Paris* a psychological sensitivity and curi- \nosity which Germans, for example, have not the slightest idea of \n(let alone the thing itself!). To achieve it, the Germans would need \na few moralistic centuries such as the French, as mentioned, did \nnot spare themselves; to call the Germans ‘naive’ as a consequence \nis fashioning praise out of a shortcoming. (As a contrast to the \nGermans’ inexperience and innocence in voluptate psychologica,* \nwhich is not totally unrelated to the tedium of their social inter- \ncourse, and as a most successful expression of a genuinely French \ncuriosity and inventive talent in this realm of tender shivers, let us \ntake Henri Beyle,* that remarkable, anticipatory and pioneering \nman who ran at a Napoleonic tempo through Ais Europe, through \nseveral centuries of the European soul, an explorer on the scent of \nthis soul. It took two generations even to catch up with him \nsomehow, to have a second guess at some of the riddles that tor- \nPeoples and Fatherlands 147 \n\n\nmented and delighted him, this strange Epicurean and question \nmark of a man who was France’s last great psychologist.) \nThere is yet a third claim to superiority: the nature of the French \npeople offers a tolerably successful synthesis of North and South, \nenabling them to comprehend much and to do much else that an \nEnglishman will never comprehend. Their temperament, period- \nically inclining towards and away from the South, occasionally \nbubbling over with Provencal and Ligurian blood, protects them \nfrom the horrible northern grey-on-grey, the sunless world of \nspectral concepts and anaemia: our German aesthetic disease, \nagainst whose excesses people today are unequivocal in prescribing \nblood and iron,* that is to say, ‘politics on a grand scale’ (submitting \nto a dangerous cure that has taught me to wait and wait, but not \nas yet to hope). Even now in France there is still a predisposition \nto understand and accommodate those rarer and rarely satisfied \npeople who are too expansive to find their satisfaction in any kind \nof fatherland-ism and know how to love what is southern about \nthe North and what is northern about the South—those born \nMediterraneans,* the ‘good Europeans’. \nTheir music has been composed by Bizet, this last genius, who \nenvisioned a new seductive beauty and discovered a bit of the South \nin music."

Into some new \nlight? Towards some new sun? But who would try to articulate \nexactly what all these masters of new linguistic forms themselves \ncould not clearly articulate? What is certain is that they were all \n\n\ntormented by the same Storm and Stress, that they all went about \nseeking in the same way, these last, great seekers! All of them with \neyes and ears ruled by literature (the first artists educated in world \nliterature);* usually writers themselves, in fact, poets, intermediaries \nand interminglers of the arts and the senses (as a musician, Wagner \nshould be classified among the painters, as a poet among the \nmusicians, as an overall artist among the actors); all of them fanatics \nof expression ‘at all costs’ (I single out Delacroix, Wagner’s closest \nrelative); all of them great explorers in the realm of the sublime, \nalso of the hideous and horrible, and even greater explorers of \neffect, of presentation, of the art of the shop window; all of them \ntalents far beyond their own genius—virtuosi through and through, \nwith uncanny access to everything that seduces, tempts, forces, \noverturns; born enemies of logic and straight lines, desirous of the \nforeign, the exotic, the monstrous, the crooked, the self-contradic- \ntory; as people, Tantaluses of the will, arriviste plebeians who knew \nthey were incapable of an aristocratic tempo, a /ento, whether in \nliving or creating (just think of Balzac, for example); unflagging \nworkers, nearly destroying themselves by their work; moral anti- \nnomians and rebels, ambitious and insatiable without equilibrium \nor pleasure; all of them ultimately shattered and brought low by \nthe Christian cross (and that is as it should be, for which of them \nwould have been deep and original enough for a philosophy of the \nAntichrist?); on the whole an audaciously daring, splendidly \npowerful, high-flying and upward-wrenching sort of higher men \nwho first had to teach their century (and it is a century of the \ncrowd!) the concept of the ‘higher man’... \nLet Richard Wagner’s German friends deliberate about whether \nthere is something particularly German in Wagnerian art, or \nwhether it is not its very distinction that it derives from supra- \nGerman sources and impulses: for in these reflections let us not \nunderestimate just how essential a role in the cultivation of his type \nwas played by Paris, a city he longed for out of a deep instinct in \nhis most crucial period, and how the whole manner of his appear- \nance, his self-apostleship could be perfected only by having \n150 Beyond Good and Evil \nencountered the model of the French socialists.* When we compare \nmore subtly, we may credit it to Richard Wagner’s German nature \nthat he carricd everything out more forcefully, boldly, harshly, \nambitiously than a Frenchman of the nineteenth century could do \n(for we Germans are still closer to barbarism than the I'rench are). \nIndeed, for the entire, so aged Latin race, the oddest thing that \nRichard Wagner ever created may be forever and not just for today \ninaccessible, unintuitable, inimitable: the figure of Siegfried, that \nvery free man, who may indeed be far too free, too harsh, too \n\n\ncheerful, too healthy, too anti-Catholic for the taste of old and \ncrumbling civilized peoples. In fact, he may even have been a sin \nagainst Romanticism, this anti-Romantic Siegfried: ah well, in his \ndreary old age Wagner richly made up for this sin when \n(anticipating an aesthetic taste that has meanwhile turned into \npolitics) he began, with his characteristic religious vehemence, to \npreach, if not to walk, the road to Rome. \nSo that no one will misunderstand these last words of mine, I \nwill also make use of some vigorous rhymes to reveal my intent to \nless finely tuned ears—what I would say against ‘late Wagner’ and \nhis Parsifal music. \n—Can this be German?— \nThis fevered shrieking from a German heart? \nA German body rends itself apart? \nGerman the priest’s hands’ invocation, \nSweet-incensed senses-titillation? \nAnd German this halting, dashing, reeling, \nThis incoherent ding-dong pealing? \nThis nuns’ eye-rolling, Ave-churchbell chiming, \nThe fake-ecstatic, pious rhyming? \n—Can this be German?— \nYou stand now at the threshold: so take heed! \nFor what you hear is Rome—Rome’s Wordless Creed!* \nSECTION NINE \nWHAT IS NOBLE?"

      "text": "While perusing the many subtler and cruder moral codes that have \nprevailed or still prevail on earth thus far, I found that certain traits \nregularly recurred in combination, linked to one another—until \nfinally two basic types were revealed and a fundamental difference \nleapt out at me. There are master moralities and slave moralities.* I \nwould add at once that in all higher and more complex cultures, \nthere are also apparent attempts to mediate between the two morali- \nties, and even more often a confusion of the two and a mutual \nmisunderstanding, indeed sometimes even their violent juxta- \nposition—even in the same person, within one single breast. Moral \nvalue distinctions have emerged either from among a masterful \n154 Beyond Good and Evil \nkind, pleasantly aware of how it differed from those whom it \nmastered, or else from among the mastered, those who were to \nvarying degrees slaves or dependants. In the first case, when it is \nthe masters who define the concept ‘good’, it is the proud, exalted \nstates of soul that are thought to distinguish and define the hier- \narchy. The noble person keeps away from those beings who express \nthe opposite of these elevated, proud inner states: he despises them. \nLet us note immediately that in this first kind of morality the \nopposition ‘good’ and ‘bad’ means about the same thing as ‘noble’ \nand ‘despicable’—the opposition ‘good’ and ‘evi? has a different \norigin. The person who is cowardly or anxious or petty or con- \ncerned with narrow utility is despised; likewise the distrustful \nperson with his constrained gaze, the self-disparager, the craven \nkind of person who endures maltreatment, the importunate flatterer, \nand above all the liar: all aristocrats hold the fundamental conviction \nthat the common people are liars. ‘We truthful ones’—that is what \nthe ancient Greek nobility called themselves. It is obvious that \nmoral value distinctions everywhere are first attributed to people \nand only later and in a derivative fashion applied to actions: for that \nreason moral historians commit a crass error by starting with \nquestions such as: ‘Why do we praise an empathetic action?’ The \nnoble type of person feels himself as determining value—he does \nnot need approval, he judges that ‘what is harmful to me is harmful \nper se’, he knows that he is the one who causes things to be revered \nin the first place, he creates values. Everything that he knows of \nhimself he reveres: this kind of moral code is self-glorifying. In the \nforeground is a feeling of fullness, of overflowing power, of happi- \nness in great tension, an awareness of a wealth that would like to \nbestow and share—the noble person will also help the unfortunate, \nbut not, or not entirely, out of pity, but rather from the urgency \ncreated by an excess of power. The noble person reveres the power \nin himself, and also his power over himself, his ability to speak and \n\n\nto be silent, to enjoy the practice of severity and harshness towards \nhimself and to respect everything that is severe and harsh. ‘Wotan \nplaced a harsh heart within my breast,’ goes a line in an old \nScandinavian saga: that is how it is written from the heart of a \nproud Viking—and rightly so. For this kind of a person is proud \nnot to be made for pity; and so the hero of the saga adds a warning: \n‘If your heart is not harsh when you are young, it will never become \nWhat is Noble? 155 \nharsh.’ The noble and brave people who think like this are the \nmost removed from that other moral code which sees the sign of \nmorality in pity or altruistic behaviour or désintéressement;* belief \nin ourselves, pride in ourselves, a fundamental hostility and irony \ntowards ‘selflessness’—these are as surely a part of a noble morality \nas caution and a slight disdain towards empathetic feelings and \n‘warm hearts’. \nIt is the powerful who understand how to revere, it is their art \nform, their realm of invention. Great reverence for old age and for \norigins (all law is based upon this twofold reverence), belief in \nancestors and prejudice in their favour and to the disadvantage of \nthe next generation—these are typical in the morality of the \npowerful; and if, conversely, people of ‘modern ideas’ believe in \nprogress and ‘the future’ almost by instinct and show an increasing \nlack of respect for old age, that alone suffices to reveal the ignoble \norigin of these ‘ideas’. Most of all, however, the master morality is \nforeign and embarrassing to current taste because of the severity \nof its fundamental principle: that we have duties only towards our \npeers, and that we may treat those of lower rank, anything foreign, \nas we think best or ‘as our heart dictates’ or in any event ‘beyond \ngood and evil’—pity and the like should be thought of in this \ncontext. The ability and duty to feel enduring gratitude or vengeful- \nness (both only within a circle of equals), subtlety in the forms of \nretribution, a refined concept of friendship, a certain need for \nenemies (as drainage channels for the emotions of envy, combative- \nness, arrogance—in essence, in order to be a good friend): these are \nthe typical signs of a noble morality, which, as we have suggested, \nis not the morality of ‘modern ideas’ and is therefore difficult to \nsympathize with these days, also difficult to dig out and uncover. \nIt is different with the second type of morality, s/ave morality. \nAssuming that the raped, the oppressed, the suffering, the shackled, \nthe weary, the insecure engage in moralizing, what will their moral \nvalue judgements have in common? They will probably express a \npessimistic suspicion about the whole human condition, and they \nmight condemn the human being along with his condition. The \nslave’s eye does not readily apprehend the virtues of the powerful: \n\n\nhe is sceptical and distrustful, he is keenly distrustful of everything \nthat the powerful revere as ‘good’—he would like to convince \nhimself that even their happiness is not genuine. Conversely, those \n156 Beyond Good and Evil \nqualities that serve to relieve the sufferers’ existence are brought \ninto relief and bathed in light: this is where pity, a kind, helpful \nhand, a warm heart, patience, diligence, humility, friendliness are \nrevered—for in this context, these qualities are most useful and \npractically the only means of enduring an oppressive existence. \nSlave morality is essentially a morality of utility. It is upon this \nhearth that the famous opposition ‘good’ and ‘evi? originates— \npower and dangerousness, a certain fear-inducing, subtle strength \nthat keeps contempt from surfacing, are translated by experience \ninto evil. According to slave morality, then, the ‘evil’ person evokes \nfear; according to master morality, it is exactly the ‘good’ person \nwho evokes fear and wants to evoke it, while the ‘bad’ person is \nfelt to be despicable. The opposition comes to a head when, in \nterms of slave morality, a hint of condescension (it may be slight \nand well intentioned) clings even to those whom this morality \ndesignates as ‘good’, since within a slave mentality a good person \nmust in any event be harmless: he is good-natured, easily deceived, \nperhaps a bit stupid, a bonhomme.* Wherever slave morality gains \nthe upper hand, language shows a tendency to make a closer associ- \nation of the words ‘good’ and ‘stupid’. \nA last fundamental difference: the longing for freedom, an instinct \nfor the happiness and nuances of feeling free, is as necessarily a \npart of slave morals and morality as artistic, rapturous reverence and \ndevotion invariably signal an aristocratic mentality and judgement. \nFrom this we can immediately understand why passionate love \n(our European speciality) absolutely must have a noble origin: the \nProvengal poet-knights are acknowledged to have invented it, those \nsplendid, inventive people of the ‘gai saber’* to whom Europe owes \nso much—virtually its very self."

Now, in fact, in conformity with the slow emergence of \na democratic order of things (this in turn caused by mixing the \nblood of masters and slaves), the originally noble and rare impulse \nto ascribe one’s own value to oneself and to ‘think well’ of oneself, \nis more and more encouraged and widespread: but always working \nagainst it is an older, broader, and more thoroughly entrenched \ntendency—and when it comes to ‘vanity’, this older tendency \nbecomes master of the newer. The vain person takes pleasure in \nevery good opinion that he hears about himself (quite irrespective \nof any prospect of its utility, and likewise irrespective of truth or \nfalsehood), just as he suffers at any bad opinion: for he submits \n158 Beyond Good and Evil \nhimself to both, he fee/s submissive to both, from that old sub- \n\n\nmissive instinct that breaks out in him. \nIt is the ‘slave’ in the blood of the vain person, a remnant of the \nslave’s craftiness (and how much of the ‘slave’ is still left, for \nexample, in women today!) that tries to seduce him to good opinions \nof himself; and it is likewise the slave who straightway kneels down \nbefore these opinions, as if he himself were not the one who had \ncalled them forth. \nSo I repeat: vanity is an atavism."

Conversely, as we know from the experiences of stock- \nbreeders, a species that is given over-abundant nourishment and \nextra protection and care generally shows an immediate and very \npronounced tendency to variations in type, and is rich in marvels \nand monstrosities (and in monstrous vices, too). Now let us consider \nan aristocratic community, such as the ancient Greek polis, say, or \nVenice, as an organization whose voluntary or involuntary purpose \nis to breed: there are people coexisting in it, relying on one another, \nwho want to further their species, chiefly because they must further \nit or run some sort of terrible risk of extermination. In such a case, \ngood will, excess, and protection, those conditions that favour \nvariation, are missing; the species needs to remain a species, some- \nthing that by virtue of its very harshness, symmetry, and simplicity \nof form, can be furthered and in general endure throughout all its \ncontinual struggles with its neighbours or with oppressed peoples \nwho threaten rebellion or revolt. From its most diverse experience \nthe species learns which qualities have particularly contributed to \nits survival, to its continuing victory in defiance of all gods and \npeoples: these qualities it calls virtues, and these are the only virtues \nthat it cultivates. It is done harshly, indeed it demands harshness; \nevery aristocratic moral code is intolerant, be it in educating its \nchildren, in disposing of its women, in its marital customs, in the \nrelations of its old and young, or in its punitive laws (which apply \nonly to the deviant); even intolerance itself is counted as a virtue, \ngoing by the name of ‘justice’. A type like this, with few but \nWhat is Noble? 159 \nvery strong characteristics, a species of severe, warlike, prudently \ntaciturn, closed and uncommunicative people (and as such most \nsubtly attuned to the charms and nuances* of society) thus becomes \n\n\nestablished beyond generational change; as mentioned above, its \ncontinual struggle with the same unfavourable conditions causes the \ntype to become fixed and harsh. Eventually, however, it arrives at \na period of good fortune, the tremendous tension relaxes; perhaps \nthere are no longer any enemies among its neighbours and its \nmeans for living, even for enjoying life, are plentiful. At one single \nstroke the coercing bond of the old discipline is torn apart: it is no \nlonger felt to be essential, critical for existence—if such discipline \nwished to endure, it could do so only as a kind of luxury, as an \narchaic taste. Variation, whether as deviance (into something higher, \nfiner, more rare) or as degeneration and monstrosity is suddenly \non the scene in all its greatest fullness and splendour; the individual \ndares to be an individual and stand out. During these historical \nturning points, we see splendid, manifold, jungle-like upgrowths \nand upsurges coexisting and often inextricably tangled up with one \nanother; competition for growth assumes a kind of tropical tempo \nand there is a tremendous perishing and causing-to-perish, owing \nto the wild egoisms that challenge one another with seeming explo- \nsiveness, struggling ‘for sun and light’, and no longer knowing how \nto derive any set of limits, any restraint, any forbearance from their \nearlier moral code. It was this very moral code, in fact, that stored \nup the energy to such a monstrous extent, that tensed the bow so \nominously—and now that code is, or is becoming ‘obsolete’. The \ndangerous and sinister point is reached where the greater, more \ndifferentiated, richer life survives beyond the old morality; the ‘indi- \nvidual’ is left standing, forced to be his own lawgiver, to create his \nown arts and wiles of self-preservation, self-advancement, self- \nredemption. Nothing left but new ‘What for?’s and new ‘How to?’s; \nno more common formulae; misunderstanding and mistrust in \nleague with one another; decline, decay, and the greatest aspirations \nterribly entangled; the genius of the race spilling good and bad out \nof all the horns of plenty; an ominous simultaneity of spring and \nautumn, full of new delights and veils that are intrinsic to the new, \nstill unplumbed, still unwearied decay. Danger is present once \nagain, the mother of morality, the great danger, this time displaced \ninto the individ ual, into the neighbour or friend, into the street, into \n160 Beyond Good and Evil \nour own children, into our own hearts, into everything that is most \nsecretly our own of wishing and wanting: what will the moral \nphilosophers who emerge during this period find to preach about? \nThey will discover, these keen observers and idlers, that things are \nquickly going downhill, that everything around them is turning to \ndecay and causing decay, that nothing lasts past tomorrow, with the \nexception of one single species of human being, the incurably \nmediocre. Vhe mediocre alone have the prospect of continuing, of \nhaving descendants—they are the people of the future, the only \n\n\nsurvivors. ‘Be like them! Become mediocre!’ will henceforth be the \nonly moral code that still makes sense, that can still find an ear. \nBut it is hard to preach, this morality of the mediocre!—it can \nnever admit to itself what it is and what it wants! It has to talk of \nproportion and dignity and duty and brotherly love—it will not \nfind it easy to Aide its irony!"

Using the same \nwords is not enough to ensure mutual understanding: we must also \nuse the same words for the same category of inner experiences; \nultimately, we must have the same experiences in common. That is \nwhy the individuals of one single people understand one another \nbetter than the members of different peoples do, even when they \nare using the same language; or to put it better, when people have \nlived for a long time under similar conditions (of climate, soil, \ndanger, necessities, work), then something comes into being as a \nresult, something that ‘goes without saying’, a people. In all their \nsouls a similar number of often-recurring experiences has prevailed \nover others less frequent: because of these experiences, they under- \nstand one another quickly, and ever more quickly (the history of \nlanguage is the history of a process of abbreviation); because of this \nquick understanding, they are connected, closely and ever more \nclosely. The greater the danger, the greater the need to agree \nquickly and easily about what is necessary; not to be misunderstood \nin times of danger—people in society find this absolutely crucial. \nWe carry out this test even in friendships or love affairs: both are \ndoomed as soon as one person discovers that the same words have \ncaused different feelings, thoughts, hunches, wishes, fears in the \n164 Beyond Good and Evil \nother person.

For it seems \nto be the rule that higher people come to ruin, that souls that are \nconstituted differently are destroyed: it is terrible to have this rule \ncontinually before our eyes. The repeated torment of a psychologist \nwho has discovered this destruction, who has made the initial, and \nthen nearly invariable discovery of all this inner ‘wretchedness’ in \nthe higher person, this eternal and all-encompassing ‘Too late!’— \nhis torment may one day make him turn with bitterness against his \nown fate and attempt self-destruction—‘come to ruin’ himself. We \nnotice that virtually every psychologist prefers the company of \nWhat is Noble? 165 \neveryday, predictable people: this reveals his constant need of \nhealing, of a sort of refuge and forgetting, far from the burdens \nthat his insights and incisions, that his ‘handiwork’ has laid on his \nconscience. He is characteristically afraid of his memory. He easily \ngrows silent at other people’s judgements: he listens with a stony \nface as they speak in terms of respect, honour, love, transfiguration \nabout matters that he has seen—or he may hide his silence by \nagreeing adamantly with some foreground opinion. The paradox \nof his situation may even reach the frightful point where those \ncases that have triggered in him great pity as well as great contempt, \nhave triggered in the crowd, the educated, the enthusiasts a feeling \nof great reverence; theirs is a reverence for ‘great men’ and per- \nforming animals, for whose sake we bless and esteem the fatherland, \nthe earth, the dignity of humanity, and ourselves; men whom we \nask our children to look up to and emulate... \nAnd who knows whether the same process has not occurred in \nall the great cases: the crowd adored a god—and the ‘god’ was only \na poor sacrificial animal! Success has always been the biggest liar— \nand the ‘work’ itself is a success; a great statesman, a conqueror, \nan explorer is disguised to the point of unrecognizability by his \ncreations; it is the ‘work’, whether of an artist or of a philosopher, \nthat first invents the creator, the one who is said to have created it. \n‘Great men’, as others revere them, are poor little tales written \nafter the fact; in the world of historical value, counterfeits predomi- \n\n\nnate.

It is understandable, then, that they are \n166 Beyond Good and Evil \nthe ones at whom women espccially (being clairvoyant in the world \nof suffering and, unfortunately, addicted to helping and rescuing \nfar beyond their abilities to do so) like to direct their outbursts of \nlimitless, utterly devoted pity, which the crowd, especially the rev- \nerent crowd, does not understand and saddles with smug or \nintrusive meanings. Women are regularly deceived about the power \nof their pity; they would like to believe that love can do anything— \nthat is their true faith. A person with true knowledge of the heart \nguesses, alas, how poor, stupid, helpless, presumptuous, misguided, \nmore easily destructive than redemptive is even the best, the deepest \nlove! \nIt is possible that beneath the holy tale and camouflage that is \nthe life of Jesus, lies hidden one of the most painful cases of \nmartyrdom out of knomledge about love: the martyrdom of the most \ninnocent and desirous heart, one that never had enough of any \nhuman love, that demanded to love and to be loved and nothing else \nbesides, with harshness, with madness, with frightful outbursts \nagainst those who denied him this love.

Who is it that I am telling you about? \nHave I forgotten myself so much that I have not even told you \nhis name? Unless, of course, you have already guessed who this \nquestionable spirit and god may be, who demands this kind of \npraise. \nLike everyone who since childhood has always been on the road \nand abroad, I too have had some strange and not necessarily harm- \nless spirits run across my path, but especially the one I was just \nspeaking about; and he has come again and again, the god Dionysus, \nno less, that great ambiguous tempter god, to whom, as you know, \nI once offered my first-born* in all secrecy and reverence. It seems \nto me that I was the last to sacrifice to him, for I found no one \nwho understood what I was doing then. Meanwhile I learned much, \nall too much more about this god’s philosophy and, as I mentioned, \nfrom mouth to mouth—I, the last disciple and initiate of the god \nDionysus, may I now be finally allowed to begin to give you, my \nfriends, a little taste, as much as I am permitted, of this philosophy? \nIn an undertone, of course: for we are talking about much that is \nsecret, new, strange, curious, uncanny. Just the very fact that Dio- \n\n\nnysus is a philosopher and that gods can philosophize too, seems \nto be something new and not without its dangers, perhaps making \nphilosophers suspicious—you, my friends, have less to object to, \nunless the news should come too late and at the wrong hour: for \nthey’ve informed me that you do not like to believe in God or gods \nthese days. And perhaps to tell my tale candidly, I must go further \nthan the severity of your listening habits would always like? Cer- \ntainly the god I named went further in such dialogues, much \nWhat is Noble? 177 \nfurther, and always kept many steps ahead of me... Indeed, if I \nwere permitted to follow the human custom and call him by \nbeautiful, ceremonious, splendid, virtuous names, I would have to \nspeak in very grand terms about his courage as an explorer and \ndiscoverer, his daring eloquence, truthfulness, and love of wisdom. \nBut this kind of a god has no use for all this worthy pomp and \nrubbish. ‘Keep this,’ he would say, ‘for yourself and your own kind \nand whoever else may need it! I—have no reason to cover my \nnakedness!’ \nDo you think that this kind of godhead and philosopher may be \nlacking in shame? \nThus, he once said, ‘In certain cases I love human beings’ (and \nhe was alluding to Ariadne, who was present); ‘to me, human beings \nare pleasant, brave, inventive animals who do not have their equal \non earth; they can find their way in any labyrinth. I am well \ndisposed towards them: I often think about how I can help them \ngo forward and make them stronger, deeper, and more evil than \nthey are.’ \n‘Stronger, deeper, and more evil?’ I asked, frightened. ‘Yes,’ he \nsaid once again, ‘stronger, deeper, and more evil—more beautiful, \ntoo.’ And at that the tempter god smiled his halcyon smile, as if \nhe had just uttered a charming compliment. This shows us two \nthings at once: shame is not the only thing that this godhead lacks; \nand there are generally good reasons to assume that in some respects \nall the gods could do with some human schooling.
