Kant was first and foremost proud of his table of \ncategories; with that in his hand he said: “This is the most difficult \nthing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.” \nLet us only understand this “could be”! He was proud of hav- \ning discovered a new faculty in man, the faculty for synthetic judg- \nments, a priori, Suppose he deceived himself in this matter; the de- \n18 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nvelopment and rapid flourishing of German philosophy depended \nnevertheless on his pride, and on the eager rivalry of the younger \ngeneration to discover, if possible, something still prouder—at all \nevents “new faculties”! \nBut Jet us reflect; it is high time to do so. “How are synthetic \njudgments a priori possible?” Kant asked himself—and what really \nis his answer? “By virtue of a faculty” *—but unfortunately not in \nfive words, but so circumstantially, venerably, and with such a dis- \nplay of German profundity and curlicues that people simply failed \nto note the comical niaiserie allemande?’ involved in such an an- \nswer. People were actually beside themselves with delight over this \nnew faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant fur- \nther discovered a moral faculty in man—for at that time the Ger- \nmans were still moral and not yet addicted to Realpolitik. \nThe honeymoon of German philosophy arrived. All the \nyoung theologians of the Tübingen seminary went into the bushes \n—all looking for “faculties.” And what did they not find—in that \ninnocent, rich, and still youthful period of the German spirit, to \nwhich romanticism, the malignant fairy, piped and sang, when one \ncould not yet distinguish between “finding” and “inventing”! 14 \nAbove all, a faculty for the “‘surprasensible”: Schelling christened it \nintellectual intuition, and thus gratified the most heartfelt cravings \nof the Germans, whose cravings were at bottom pious.

But that “immediate certainty,” as well as “absolute \nknowledge” and the “thing in itself,” involve a contradictio in ad- \njecto,** I shall repeat a hundred times; we really ought to free our- \nselves from the seduction of words! \nLet the people suppose that knowledge means knowing things \nentirely; the philosopher must say to himself; When I analyze the \nprocess that is expressed in the sentence, “I think,” I find a whole \nseries of daring assertions that would be difficult, perhaps impossi- \nble, to prove; for example, that it is J who think, that there must \nnecessarily be something that thinks, that thinking is an activity \nand operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause, \nthat there is an “ego,” and, finally, that it is already determined \nwhat is to be designated by thinking —that I know what thinking i is. \nFor if I had not already decided within myself what it is, by what \nstandard could I determine whether that which is just happening is \nnot perhaps “willing” or “feeling”? In short, the assertion “I think” \nassumes that I compare my state at the present moment with other \nstates of myself which I know, in order to determine what it is; on \naccount of this retrospective connection with further “knowledge,” \nit has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for me. \nIn Place of the “immediate certainty” in which the people may \nbelieve in the case at hand, the philosopher thus finds a series of \n29 Reduction to the absurd, \n\n\n20 Something that is its own cause—a.term traditionally applied to God, \n2!

Why do I believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right \nto speak of an ego, and even of an ego as cause, and finally of an \nego as the cause of thought?” Whoever ventures to answer these \nmetaphysical questions at once by an appeal to a sort of intuitive \nperception, like the person who says, “I think, and know that this, \nat least, is true, actual, and certain”—will encounter a smile and \ntwo question marks from a philosopher nowadays. “Sir,” the phi- \nlosopher will perhaps give him to understand, “it is improbable that \nyou are not mistaken; but why insist on the truth?”—"

      "text": "Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as if it were \nthe best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given \nus to understand that the will alone is really known to us, ab- \nsolutely and completely known, without subtraction or addition. \nBut again and again it seems to me that in this case, too, Schopen- \nhauer only did what philosophers are in the habit of doing—he \nadopted a popular prejudice and exaggerated it. Willing seems to \nme to be above all something complicated, something that is a unit \nonly as a word—and it is precisely in this one word that the popular \nprejudice lurks, which has defeated the always inadequate cau- \ntion of philosophers. So let us for once be more cautious, let us be \n“unphilosophical”: let us say that in all willing there is, first, a \nplurality of sensations, namely, the sensation of the state “away \nfrom which,” the sensation of the state “towards which,” the sensa- \ntions of this “from” and “towards” themselves, and then also an ac- \ncompanying muscular sensation, which, even without our putting \ninto motion “arms and legs,” begins its action by force of habit as \nsoon as we “will” anything. \nTherefore, just as sensations (and indeed many kinds of sen- \nsations) are to be recognized as ingredients of the will, so, secondly, \nshould thinking also: in every act of the will there is a ruling \nthought—let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from \nthe “willing,” as if any will would then remain over! \nThird, the will is not only a complex of sensation and think- \ning, but it is above all an affect, and specifically the affect of the \ncommand, That which is termed “freedom of the will” is essen- \ntially the affect of superiority in relation to him who must obey:. “I \nam free, ‘he’ must obey”—this consciousness is inherent in every \nwill; and equally so the straining of the attention, the straight look \nthat fixes itself exclusively on one aim, the unconditional evalua- \ntion that “this and nothing else is necessary now,” the inward \n26 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \n\n\ncertainty that obedience will be rendered—-and whatever else be- \nlongs to the position of the commander. A man who wills com- \nmands something within himself that renders obedience, or that he \nbelieves renders obedience. \nBut now let us notice what is strangest about the will—this \nmanifold thing for which the people have only one word: inas- \nmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the same time the \ncommanding and the obeying parties, and as the obeying party we \nknow the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, \nand motion, which usually begin immediately after the act of will; \ninasmuch as, on the other hand, we are accustomed to disregard \nthis duality, and to deceive ourselves about it by means of the syn- \nthetic concept “I,” a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and \nconsequently of false evaluations of the will itself, has become at- \ntached to the act of willing—to such a degree that he who wills be- \nlieves sincerely that willing suffices for action. Since in the great \nmajority of cases there has been exercise of will only when the ef- \nfect of the command—that is, obedience; that is, the action—was \nto be expected, the appearance has translated itself into the feeling, \nas if there were a necessity of effect. In short, he who wills believes \nwith a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow \none; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing, to the \nwill itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power \nwhich accompanies all success. \n“Freedom of the will”—that is the expression for the complex \nstate of delight of the person exercising volition, who commands \nand at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the or- \nder—who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but \nthinks within himself that it was really his will itself that overcame \nthem. In this way the person exercising volition adds the feelings of \ndelight of his successful executive instruments, the useful “under- \nwills” or under-souls—indeed, our body is but a social structure \ncomposed of many souls—to his feelings of delight as commander. \nL'effet c'est moi? what happens here is what happens in every \nwell-constructed and happy commonwealth; namely, the governing \n22 “7 am the effect.” \nON THE PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS 27 \nclass identifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth. In all \nwilling it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on \nthe basis, as already said, of a social structure composed of many \n“souls.” Hence a philosopher should claim the right to include will- \n\n\ning as such within the sphere of morals—morals being understood \nas the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phe- \nnomenon of “life” comes to be."

The desire for “free~ \ndom of the will” in the superlative metaphysical sense, which still \nholds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated; the \ndesire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one’s ac- \ntions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, \nand society involves nothing less than to be precisely this causa sui \nand, with more than Münchhausen’s audacity, to pull oneself up \ninto existence by the hair, out of the swamps of nothingness.** Sup- \n23 Cf. Sartre's famous dictum: “If man as the existentialist sees him is not \ndefinable, it is because to begin with he is nothing. He will not be anything \nuntil later, and then he will be what he makes of himself. . . . Man simply \nis. Not that he is simply what he conceives himself to be, but he is what he \nwills . . . Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself, That \nis the first principle of existentialism. . . . Before that projection of the \nself nothing exists . .. Man is responsible for what he is. Thus, the first \neffect of existentialism is that it puts every man in possession of himself as \nhe is, and places the entire responsibility for his existence squarely upon his \nown shoulders” (“Existentialism Is a Humanism,” included in Existential- \nism from Dostoevsky to Sartre, ed. Walter Kaufmann, pp. 290f.). \nReading this without knowing that Beyond Good and Evil was published \nin 1886 and Sartre's lecture in 1946, one would scarcely guess at Nietzsche's \nimmense influence on existentialism in general and Sartre in particular; one \nmight even suppose that Nietzsche was here polemicizing against Sartre, Cf, \nalso section 8 of “The Four Great Errors” in Twilight of the Idols (Porta- \nble Nietzsche, p. 500), where some implications of the above passage in \nBeyond Good and Evil are developed briefly, \nON THE PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS 29 \npose someone were thus to see through the boorish simplicity of this \ncelebrated concept of “free will” and put it out of his head alto- \ngether, I beg of him to carry his “enlightenment” a step further, and \nalso put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception \nof “free will”: I mean “unfree will,” which amounts to a misuse of \ncause and effect. One should not wrongly reify “cause” and “ef- \nfect,” as the natural scientists do (and whoever, like them, now \n“naturalizes” in his thinking), according to the prevailing mechan- \nical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until it “ef- \n\n\nfects” its end; one should use “cause” and “effect” only as pure con- \ncepts, that is to say, as conventional fictions for the purpose of \ndesignation and communication—not for explanation. In the “in- \nitself” there is nothing of “causal connections,” of “necessity,” or of \n“psychological non-freedom”; there the effect does not follow the \ncause, there is no rule of “law.” It is we alone who have devised \ncause, sequence, for-each-other, relativity, constraint, number, \nlaw, freedom, motive, and purpose; and when we project and mix \nthis symbol world into things as if it existed “in itself,” we act \nonce more as we have always acted—mythologically. The “unfree \nwill” is mythology; in real life it is only a matter of strong and weak \nwills. \nIt is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself \nwhen a thinker senses in every “causal connection” and “psycho- \nlogical necessity” something of constraint, need, compulsion to \nobey, pressure, and unfreedom; it is suspicious to have such feelings \n—the person betrays himself. And in general, if I have observed \ncorrectly, the “unfreedom of the will” is regarded as a problem \nfrom two entirely opposite standpoints, but always in a profoundly \npersonal manner: some will not give up their “responsibility,” their \nbelief in themselves, the personal right to their merits at any price \n(the vain races belong to this class). Others, on the contrary, do not \nwish to be answerable for anything, or blamed for anything, and \nowing to an inward self-contempt, seek to lay the blame for them- \nselves somewhere else. The latter, when they write books, are in \nthe habit today of taking the side of criminals; a sort of socialist pity \nis their most attractive disguise. And as a matter of fact, the fatal- \n30 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nism of the weak-willed embellishes itself surprisingly when it can \npose as “la religion de la souffrance humaine”;?4 that is its “good \ntaste,”"

It was rather the way a distinction or disgrace still reaches back \ntoday from a child to its parents, in China: it was the retroactive \nforce of success or failure that Jed men to think well or ill of an ac- \ntion. Let us call this period the pre-moral period of mankind: the \nimperative “know thyself!” was as yet unknown. \nIn the last ten thousand years, however, one has reached the \npoint, step by step, in a few large regions on the earth, where it is no \nlonger the consequences but the origin of an action that one allows \nto decide its value. On the whole this is a great event which in- \nvolves a considerable refinement of vision and standards; it is the \nunconscious aftereffect of the rule of aristocratic values and the \nfaith in “descent”—the sign of a period that one may call moral in \nthe narrower sense.

      "text": "Has it ever been really noted to what extent a genuinely reli- \ngious life (both its microscopic favorite occupation of self- \nexamination and that tender composure which calls itself “prayex” \nand is a continual readiness for the “coming of God”) requires a lei- \nsure class, or half-leisure—I mean leisure with a good conscience, \nfrom way back, by blood, to which the aristocratic feeling that \nwork disgraces is not altogether alien—-the fecling that it makes \nsoul and body common. And that consequently our modern, \nnoisy, time-consuming industriousness, proud of itself, stupidly \nproud, educates and prepares people, more than anything else does, \nprecisely for “unbelief.” \nAmong those, for example, who now live in Germany at a \ndistance from religion I find people whose “free-thinking” is of \ndiverse types and origins, but above all a majority of those in \nwhom industriousness has, from generation unto generation, dis- \nsolved the religious instincts, so they no longer even know what \nreligions are good for and merely register their presence in the \nworld with a kind of dumb amazement, They feel abundantly com- \nmitted, these good people, whether to their business or to their \npleasures, not to speak of the “fatherland” and the newspapers and \n“family obligations”: it seems that they simply have no time left \nfor religion, the more so because it remains unclear to them \nwhether it involves another business or another pleasure—for it is \nnot possible, they say to themselves, that one goes to church merely \nto dampen one’s good spirits. They are not enemies of religious cus- \ntoms; when participation in such customs is required in certain \ncases, by the state, for example, they do what is required, as one \n70 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \ndoes so many things—with a patient and modest seriousness and \nwithout much curiosity and discomfort: they simply live too much \napart and outside to feel any need for any pro and con in such mat- \nters. \nThose indifferent in this way include today the great majority \nof German middle-class Protestants, especially in the great indus- \ntrious centers of trade and traffic; also the great majority of indus- \ntrious scholars and the other accessories of the universities (except- \ning the theologians, whose presence and possibility there pose ever \nincreasing and ever subtler riddles for a psychologist). Pious or \neven merely churchly people rarely have the slightest idea how \nmuch good will—one might say caprice—is required of a German \nscholar today if he is to take the problem of religion seriously. On \nthe basis of his whole trade (and, as noted, on the basis of the \ntradelike industriousness to which he is committed by his modern \nconscience) he ‘is inclined toward-a superior, almost good-natured \n\n\namusement in the face of teliglon, Boney mixed with a dash \nwherever a church i is still acknowledged. The scholar succeeds only \nwith the-help of history (not on the basis of his own personal ex- \nperience) to muster a reverent seriousness and a certain shy con= \nsideration in the face of religion, But even if he raises his feeling \ninto real gratitude toward it,® he still has not personally ap- \nproached, not even by a single step, what still exists now as church \nor piety; perhaps even the opposite. The practical indifference to- \nward religious matters into which he has been born and brought up \nis generally sublimated in him into caution and cleanliness that \nshun contact with religious men and matters; and it may be pre- \ncisely the depth of his tolerance and humanity that bids him dodge \nthe subtle distress involved in tolerance, \nEvery age has its own divine type of naiveté for whose inven- \ntion other ages may envy it—and how much naiveté, venerable, \nchildlike, and boundlessly clumsy naïveté lies in the scholar’s faith \nin his superiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance, in the un- \n18 In other words, even if he rises above all resentment and sees only the \ngood done by religion, \nWHAT 18 RELIGIOUS 71 \nsuspecting simple certainty with which his instinct treats the reli- \ngious man as an inferior and lower type that he has outgrown, leav- \ning it behind, beneath him—him, that presumptuous little dwarf \nand rabble man, the assiduous and speedy head- and handiworker \nof “ideas,” of “modern ideas”!"

The selective and cultivating?! influence, always de- \nstructive as well as creative and form-giving, which can be exerted \nwith the help of religions, is always multiple and different accord- \ning to the sort of human beings who are placed under its spell and \nprotection. For the strong and independent who are prepared and \npredestined to command and in whom the reason and art of a gov- \nering race become incarnate, religion is one more means for over- \ncoming resistances, for the ability to rule—as a bond that unites \nrulers and subjects and betrays and delivers the consciences of the \nlatter, that which is most concealed and intimate and would like \nto elude obedience, to the former. And if a few individuals of such \n10 Probably an allusion to Exodus 4:10: the context requires us to think of \nMoses, in any case, \n20 Seinem Züchtungs- und Erziehungswerke, \n21 Züchtende, \nWHAT 15 RELIGIOUS 73 \nnoble descent are inclined through lofty spirituality to prefer a \nmore withdrawn and contemplative life and reserve for themselves \nonly the most subtle type of rule (over selected disciples or brothers \nin some order), then religion can even be used as a means for ob- \ntaining peace from the noise and exertion of cruder forms of gov- \nernment, and purity from the necessary dirt of all politics. That is \nhow the Brahmins, for example, understood things: by means of a \nreligious organization they gave themselves the power of nominat- \ning the kings of the people while they themselves kept and felt \napart and outside, as men of higher and supra-royal tasks. \nMeanwhile religion also gives to some of the ruled the in- \nstruction and opportunity to prepare themselves for future ruling \nand obeying: those slowly ascending classes—in which, thanks to \nfortunate marital customs, the strength and joy of the will, the will \nto self-control is ever growing—receive enough nudges and \ntemptations from religion to walk the paths to higher spirituality, \nto test the feelings of great self-overcoming, of silence and solitude. \nAsceticism and puritanism are almost indispensable means for \neducating and ennobling a race that wishes to become master over \nits origins among the rabble and that works its way up toward fu- \nture rule. \nTo ordinary human beings, finally—the vast majority who \nexist for service and the general advantage, and who may exist only \nfor that—religion gives an inestimable contentment with their situ- \n\n\nation and type, manifold peace of the heart, an ennobling of obedi- \nence, one further happiness and sorrow with their peers and some- \nthing transfiguring and beautifying, something of a justification \nfor the whole everyday character, the whole lowliness, the whole \nhalf-brutish poverty of their souls. Religion and religious signifi- \ncance spread the splendor of the sun over such ever-toiling human \nbeings and make their own sight tolerable to them. Religion has \nthe same effect which an Epicurean philosophy has on sufferers of \na higher rank: it is refreshing, refining, makes, as it were, the most \nof suffering, and in the end even sanctifies and justifies, Perhaps \nnothing in Christianity or Buddhism is as venerable as their art of \nteaching even the lowliest how to place themselves through piety \n74 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nin an illusory higher order of things and thus to maintain their con- \ntentment with the real order, in which their life is hard enough— \nand precisely this hardness is necessary."

There is among men as in every other animal species \nan excess of failures, of the sick, degenerating, infirm, who suffer \nnecessarily; the successful cases are, among men too, always the \nexception—and in view of the fact that man is the as yet undeter- \nmined animal, the rare exception. But still worse: the higher the \ntype of man that a man represents, the greater the improbability \nthat he will turn out well, The accidental, the law of absurdity in \nthe whole economy of mankind, manifests itself most horribly in \nits destructive effect on the higher men whose complicated condi- \ntions of life can only be calculated with great subtlety and diffi- \nculty. \nWhat, then, is the attitude of the above-mentioned two great- \nest religions toward this excess of cases that did not turn out right? \nThey seek to preserve, to preserve alive whatever can possibly be \npreserved; indeed, as a matter of principle, they side with these \ncases as religions for sufferers; they agree with all those who suffer \nlife like a sickness and would like to make sure that every other \nfeeling about life should be considered false and should become \n\n\nimpossible, Even if the very highest credit is given to this consid- \nerate and preserving care, which, besides being directed toward \nall the others, was and is also directed toward the highest type of \nman, the type that so far has almost always suffered most; never- \ntheless, in a totai accounting, the sovereign religions we have had \nso far are among the chief causes that have kept the type “man” \non a lower rung—they have preserved too much of what ought to \nWHAT 18 RELIGIOUS 75 \nperish. What we have to thank them for is inestimable; and who \ncould be rich enough in gratitude not to be impoverished in view of \nall that the “spiritual men” of Christianity, for example, have so \nfar done for Europe! And yet, when they gave comfort to sufferers, \ncourage to the oppressed and despairing, a staff and support to the \ndependent, and lured away from society into monasteries and \npenitentiaries for the soul those who had been destroyed inwardly \nand who had become savage: how much more did they have to do \nbesides, in order to work with a good conscience and on principle, \nto preserve all that was sick and that suffered—which means, in \nfact and in truth, to worsen the European race? Stand all valuations \non their head—that is what they had to do. And break the strong, \nsickly o'er? great hopes, cast suspicion on the joy in beauty, bend \neverything haughty, manly, conquering, domineering, all the in- . \nstincts characteristic of the highest and best-turned-out type of \n“man,” into unsureness, agony of conscience, self-destruction— \nindeed, invert all love of the earthly and of dominion over the \nearth into hatred of the earth and the earthly—that is the task the \nchurch posed for itself and had to pose, until in its estimation “be- \ncoming unworldly,” “unsensual,” and “higher men” were fused \ninto a single feeling. \nSuppose we could contemplate the oddly painful and equally \ncrude and subtle comedy of European Christianity with the mock- \ning and aloof eyes of an Epicurean god, I think our amazement \nand laughter would never end: doesn’t it seem that a single will \ndominated Europe for eighteen centuries—to turn man into a \nsublime miscarriage? Anyone, however, who approached this al- \nmost deliberate degeneration and atrophy of man represented by \nthe Christian European (Pascal, for example), feeling the oppo- \nsite kind of desire, not in an Epicurean spirit but rather with some \ndivine hammer in his hand, would surely have to cry out in wrath, \nin pity, in horror: “O you dolts, you presumptuous, pitying dolts, \nwhat have you done!

      "text": "The moral sentiment in Europe today is as refined, old, diverse, \nirritable, and subtle, as the “science of morals” that accompanies it \nis still young, raw, clumsy, and butterfingered—an attractive con- \ntrast that occasionally even becomes visible and incarnate in the \nperson of a moralist. Even the term “science of morals” is much too \narrogant considering what it designates, and offends good taste— \nwhich always prefers more modest terms. \nOne should own up in all strictness to what is still necessary \nhere for a long time to come, to what alone is justified so far: to \ncollect material, to conceptualize and arrange a vast realm of subtle \nfeelings of value and differences of value which are alive, grow, \nbeget, and perish—and perhaps attempts to present vividly some of \nthe more frequent and recurring forms of such living crystalliza- \ntions—all to prepare a typology of morals. \nTo be sure, so far one has not been so modest. With a stiff seri- \n\n\nousness that inspires laughter, all our philosophers demanded \nsomething far more exalted, presumptuous, and solemn from \nthemselves as soon as they approached the study of morality: they \nwanted to supply a rational foundation for morality—and every \nphilosopher so far has believed that he has provided such a foun- \ndation. Morality itself, however, was accepted as “given.” How re- \nmote from their clumsy pride was that task which they considered \ninsignificant and left in dust and must—the task of description— \nalthough the subtlest fingers and senses can scarcely be subtle \nenough for it. \nJust because our moral philosophers knew the facts of moral- \nity only very approximately in arbitrary extracts or in accidental \nepitomes—for example, as the morality of their environment, their \nclass, their church, the spirit of their time, their climate and part of \nthe world—just because they were poorly informed and not even \nvery curious about different peoples, times, and past ages—they \n98 BEYOND 000D AND BVIL \nnever laid eyes on the real problems of morality; for these emerge \nonly when we compare many moralities. In all “science of morals” \nso far one thing was lacking, strange as it may sound: the problem of \nmorality itself; what was lacking was any suspicion that there was \nsomething problematic here. What the philosophers called “a ra- \ntional foundation for morality” and tried to supply was, seen in the \nright light, merely a scholarly variation of the common faith in the \nprevalent morality; a new means of expression for this faith; and \nthus just another fact within a particular morality; indeed, in the \nlast analysis a kind of denial that this morality might ever be con- \nsidered problematic—certainly the very opposite of an examina- \ntion, analysis, questioning, and vivisection of this very faith. \nListen, for example, with what almost venerable innocence \nSchopenhauer still described his task, and then draw your conclu- \nsions about the scientific standing of a “science” whose ultimate \nmasters still talk like children and little old women: “The principle,” \nhe says (p. 136 of Grundprobleme der Moral)! “the fundamental \n1 First edition of 1886 and second edition of 1891: “das Princip, sagt er \n(p. 136 der Grundprobleme der Moral), der Grundsatz . . .” \nMusarion edition of the Werke: “das Princip, sagt er (p. 137 der \nGrundprobleme der Ethik), der Grundsatz . . .” \nSchlechta’s edition, ech, ol to follow the original edition, actu- \na even a little er from it than the Musarionausgabe: “das \n\n\nbe ip ‚sagt er (S. 137 der Grundprobleme der Ethik), “der Grund- \nB8lZ s s» \nThe correct title of Schopenhauer’s book is Die beiden Grundprobleme \nder Ethik (the two fundamental problems of ethics), and in the original \nedition of 1841 the quoted passage is found on p. 138. Nietzsche neither \nplaced the title in quotes nor italicized it, and his slight variation of the \ntitle ig less odd than the fact that on Schopenhauer’s own title page of 1841 \nthe title of the second essay, which Nietzsche cites, is given as “Ueber das \nFundament der Moral, nicht gekrönt von der K. Dänischen Societät der \nWissenschaften, zu Kopenhagen, den 30, Januar 1840” (“On the Founda- \ntion of Morals, not awarded a prize by the Danish Royal Society .. .”). \nTurning the page, one finds the table of contents, in which the title of the \nsecond essay is given as follows: “Preisschrift über die Grundlage der \nMoral” (Prize essay on the basis of morals). (The heading on p. 101 agrees \nwith the table of contents, not with Schopenhauer's title page.) If it al \nhauer could say in one instance Fundament and in the other Grundiage, \nNietzsche might as well say Moral instead of Ethik; moreover, the word \nin the title that concerned Nietzsche was Moral, not Ethik. \nThe editora who changed the title and page reference given by Nietzsche \nfailed to insert three dots in the quotation itself, to indicate a minor omise \nNATURAL HISTORY OF MORALS 99 \nproposition on whose contents all moral philosophers are really? \nagreed—neminem laede, immo omnes, quantum potes, juva? \nthat is really the proposition for which all moralists endeavor to find \nthe rational foundation . . . the real basis of ethics for which \none has been looking for thousands of years as for the philosopher’s \nstone.” \nThe difficulty of providing a rational foundation for the princi- \nple cited may indeed be great—as is well known, Schopenhauer did \nnot succeed either—and whoever has once felt deeply how in- \nsipidly false and sentimental this principle is in a world whose es- \nsence is will to power, may allow himself to be reminded that \nSchopenhauer, though a pessimist, really—played the flute. Every \nday,-after dinner: one should read his biography on that. And in- \ncidentally: a pessimist, one who denies God and the world but \ncomes to a stop before morality—who affirms morality and plays \nthe flute—the laede neminem morality—what? is that really—a \npessimist?"

What is essential and inestimable in every morality is \nthat it constitutes a long compulsion: to understand Stoicism or Port- \nRoyal or Puritanism, one should recall the compulsion under \nwhich every language so far has achieved strength and freedom— \nthe metrical compulsion of rhyme and rhythm. \nHow much trouble the poets and orators of all peoples have \ntaken—not excepting a few prose writers today in whose ear there \ndwells an inexorable consciencee—\"for the sake of some foolish- \nness.” as utilitarian dolts say, feeling smart—\"submitting abjectly \n\n\nto capricious laws,” as anarchists say, feeling “free.” even “free- \nspirited.” But the curious fact is that all there is or has been on \nearth of freedom, subtlety, boldness, dance, and masterly sureness, \nwhether in thought itself or in government, or in rhetoric and per- \nsuasion, in the arts just as in ethics, has developed only owing to \nthe “tyranny of such capricious laws”; and in all seriousness, the \nprobability is by no means small that precisely this is “nature” and \n“natural”—-and not that laisser aller. \nEvery artist knows how far from any feeling of letting himself \ngo his “most natural” state is—the free ordering, placing, disposing, \ngiving form in the moment of “inspiration”—and how strictly \nand subtly he obeys thousandfold laws precisely then, laws that \nprecisely on account of their hardness and determination defy all \nformulation through concepts (even the firmest concept is, com- \n4 Letting go, \nNATURAL HISTORY OF MORALS 101 \npared with them, not free of fluctuation, multiplicity, and ambigu- \nity). \n: What is essential “in heaven and on earth” seems to be, to say \nit once more, that there should be obedience over a long period of \ntime and in a single direction: given that, something always devel- \nops, and has developed, for whose sake it is worth while to live on \nearth; for example, virtue, art, music, dance, reason, spirituality— \nsomething transfiguring, subtle, mad, and divine. The long unfree- \ndom of the spirit, the mistrustful constraint in the communicability \nof thoughts, the discipline thinkers imposed on themselves to think \nwithin the directions laid down by a church or court, or under Aris- \ntotelian presuppositions, the long spiritual will to interpret all \nevents under a Christian schema and to rediscover and justify the \nChristian god in every accident—all this, however forced, capri- \ncious, hard, gruesome, and anti-rational, has shown itself to be the \nmeans through which the European spirit has been trained to \nstrength, ruthless curiosity, and subtle mobility, though admittedly \nin the process an irreplaceable amount of strength and spirit had to \nbe crushed, stifled, and ruined (for here, as everywhere, “nature” \nmanifests herself as she is, in all her prodigal and indifferent mag- \nnificence which is outrageous but noble). \nThat for thousands of years European thinkers thought merely \nin order to prove something—today, conversely, we suspect every \nthinker who “wants to prove something”—that the conclusions \nthat ought to be the result of their most rigorous reflection were al- \n\n\nways settled from the start, just as it used to be with Asiatic as- \ntrology, and still is today with the innocuous Christian-moral inter- \npretation of our most intimate personal experiences “for the glory \nof God” and “for the salvation of the soul”—this tyranny, this ca- \nprice, this rigorous and grandiose stupidity has educated the spirit. \nSlavery is, as it seems, both in the cruder and in the more subtle \nsense, the indispensable means of spiritual discipline and cultiva- \ntion,’ too. Consider any morality with this in mind: what there is in \nit of “nature” teaches hatred of the laisser aller, of any all-too-great \n5 Zucht und Züchtung. \n102 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nfreedom, and implants the need for limited horizons and the near- \nest tasks—teaching the narrowing of our perspective, and thus \nin a certain sense stupidity, as a condition of life and growth. \n“You shall obey—someone and for a long time: else you will \nperish and lose the last respect for yourself\"—this appears to me \nto be the moral imperative of nature which, to be sure, is neither \n“categorical” as the old Kant would have it (hence the “else”) nor \naddressed to the individual (what do individuals matter to her?), \nbut to peoples, races, ages, classes—but above all to the whole hu- \nman animal, to man."

One has \nto see to it that they as well as reason receive their due—one must \nfollow the instincts but persuade reason to assist them with good \nreasons. This was the real falseness of that great ironic, so rich in \nsecrets; he got his conscience to be satisfied with.a kind of self- \ntrickery: at bottom, he had seen through the irrational element in \nmoral judgments. \nPlato, more innocent in such matters and lacking the crafti- \nness of the plebeian, wanted to employ all his strength—the great- \nest strength any philosopher so far has had at his disposal—to \nprove to himself that reason and instinct of themselves tend toward \none goal, the good, “God.” And since Plato, all theologians and \nphilosophers are on the same track—that is, in moral matters it has \nso far been instinct, or what the Christians call “faith,” or “the \nherd,” as I put it, that has triumphed. Perhaps Descartes should be \nexcepted, as the father of rationalism (and hence the grandfather \nof the Revolution) who conceded authority to reason alone: but \nreason is merely an instrument, and Descartes was superficial."

Sometimes it was the specialist and nook \ndweller who instinctively resisted any kind of synthetic enterprise \nand talent; sometimes the industrious worker who had got a whiff \nof otium? and the noble riches in the psychic economy of the phi- \nlosopher which had made him feel defensive and small.

It is especially the \nsight of those hodgepodge philosophers who call themselves “phi- \nlosophers of reality” or “positivists” that is capable of injecting a \ndangerous mistrust into the soul of an ambitious young scholar: \nthese are at best scholars and specialists themselves—that is pal- \npable--they are all losers who have-been brought back under the \nhegemony of science, after having desired more of themselves at \nsome time without having had the right to this “more” and its re- \nsponsibilities—and who now represent, in word and deed, honora- \nbly, resentfully, and vengefully, the unbelief in the masterly task \nand masterfulness of philosophy. \nFinally: how could it really be otherwise?

Not reflection, no—true \nknowledge, an insight into the horrible truth, outweighs any motive for \naction” (section 7). \n20 In German, conscience bites. Cf. the medieval “agenbite of inwit” of \nwhich James Joyce makes much in Ulysses, \n130 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \ntoo; the sphinx, too, is a Circe; Circe, too, was a philosopher.” \nThus a skeptic consoles himself; and it is true that he stands \nin need of some consolation. For skepticism is the most spiritual \nexpression of a certain complex physiological condition that in or- \ndinary language is called nervous exhaustion and sickliness; it al- \nways develops when races or classes that have long been sepa- \nrated are crossed suddenly and decisively. In the new generation \nthat, as it were, has inherited in its blood diverse standards and val- \nues, everything is unrest, disturbance, doubt, attempt; the best \nforces have an inhibiting effect, the very virtues do not allow each \nother to grow and become strong; balance, a center of gravity, and \nperpendicular poise are lacking in body and soul. But what be- \ncomes sickest and degenerates most in such hybrids is the will: \nthey no longer know independence of decisions and the intrepid \n- sense of pleasure in willing—they doubt the “freedom of the will” \neven in their dreams. \nOur Europe of today, being the arena of an absurdly sudden \nattempt at a radical mixture of classes, arid hence races, is there- \nfore skeptical in all its heights and depths—sometimes with that \n\n\nmobile skepticism which leaps impatiently and lasciviously from \nbranch to branch, sometimes dismal like a cloud overcharged with \nquestion marks—and often mortally sick of its will. Paralysis of \nthe will: where today does one not find this cripple sitting? And \noften in such finery! How seductive the finery looks! This disease \nenjoys the most beautiful pomp- and lie-costumes; and most of \nwhat today displays itself in the showcases, for example, as “ob- \njectivity,” “being scientific,” “Tart pour l'art,” “pure knowledge, free \nof will,” is merely dressed-up skepticism and paralysis of the will: \nfor this diagnosis of the European sickness I vouch. \nThe sickness of the will is spread unevenly over Europe: it \nappears strongest and most manifold where culture has been at \nhome longest; it disappears to the extent to which the “barbarian” \nstill—or again—claims his rights under the loose garments of West- \nern culture. In France today the will is accordingly most seriously \nsick, which is as easy to infer as it is palpable. And France, having \nalways possessed a masterly skill at converting even the most ca- \nlamitous turns of its spirit into something attractive and seductive, \nWE SCHOLARS 131 \nnow really shows its cultural superiority over Europe by being the \nschool and display of all the charms of skepticism. \nThe strength to will, and to will something for a Jong time, is a \nlittle greater in Germany, and more so in the German north than in \nthe center of Germany; but much stronger yet in England, Spain, \nand Corsica, here in association with indolence, there with hard \nheads—not to speak of Italy, which is too young to know what it \nwants and still has to prove whether it is able to will—but it is \nstrongest and most amazing by far in that enormous empire in be- \ntween, where Europe, as it were, flows back into Asia, in Russia. \nThere the. strength to will has long been accumulated and stored up, \nthere the will—uncertain whether as a will to negate or a will to af- \nfirm—is waiting menacingly to be discharged, to borrow a pet \nphrase of our physicists today. It may well take more than Indian \nwars and complications in Asia to rid Europe of its greatest dan- \nger: internal upheavals would be needed, too, the shattering of \nthe empire into small units, and above all the introduction of the \nparliamentary nonsense, including the obligation for everybody to \nread his newspaper with his breakfast. \nI do not say this because I want it to happen: the opposite \nwould be rather more after my heart—I mean such an increase in \nthe menace of Russia that Europe would have to resolve to become \nmenacing, too, namely, to acquire one will by means of a new caste \nthat would rule Europe, a long, terrible will of its own that would be \n\n\nable to cast its goals millennia hence—so the long-drawn-out com- \nedy of its many splinter states as well as its dynastic and democratic \nsplinter wills would come to an end.

Thanks to \nthe unconquerably strong and tough virility of the great German \nphilologists and critical historians (viewed properly, all of them \nwere also artists of destruction and dissolution), a new concept of \nthe German spirit crystallized gradually in spite of all romanticism \n20 Frederick William I, reigned 1713-40, \nWE SCHOLARS 133 \nin music and philosophy, and the inclination to virile skepticism be- \ncame a decisive trait, now, for example, as an intrepid eye, now as \nthe courage and hardness of analysis, as the tough will to under- \ntake dangerous journeys of exploration and spiritualized North \nPole expeditions under desolate and dangerous skies.?? \nThere may be good reasons why warmblooded and superficial \nhumanitarians cross themselves just when they behold this spirit— \ncet esprit fataliste, ironique, méphistophélique, Michelet calls it, \nnot without a shudder. But if we want to really feel what a distinc- \ntion such fear of the “man” in the German spirit confers—a spirit \nthrough which Europe was after all awakened from her “dog- \nmatic slumber” *\"—we have to remember the former conception \nwhich was replaced by this one: it was not so long ago that a mascu- \nlinized woman could dare with unbridled presumption to com- \nmend the Germans to the sympathy of Europe as being gentle, \ngoodhearted, weak-willed, and poetic dolts.® At long last we \nought to understand deeply enough Napoleon’s surptise when he \ncame to see Goethe: it shows what people had associated with the \n“German spirit” for centuries. “Voila un hommel”—that meant: \n“But this is a man! And I had merely expected a German.” ?!— \n27 It is essential for understanding Nietzsche to realize that he is not “for” \nor “against” skepticism, but that he analyzes one type of skepticism with \ndisdain (section 208) before describing another with which he clearly iden- \ntifies himself. It is equally characteristic that when he joins his countrymen \nin admiration of Frederick the Great, he pays tribute to him not for his \nexploits and conquests but rather for his skepticism, and that his praise of \n“tough virility” is aimed at the sublimated, spiritual version found, for \nexample, in philologists and historians.

But nowadays all the world talks of \nthings of which it cannot have any experience, and this is most \ntrue, and in the worst way, concerning philosophers and philosoph- \nical states: exceedingly few know them, may know them, and all \npopular opinions about them are false. \nThat genuinely philosophical combination, for example, of a \nbold and exuberant spirituality that runs presto and a dialectical \nseverity and necessity that takes no false step is unknown to most \nthinkers and scholars from their own experience, and therefore \nwould seem incredible to them if somebody should speak of it in \ntheir presence, They picture every necessity as a kind of need, as a \npainstaking having-to-follow and being-compelled. And thinking \nitself they consider something slow and hesitant, almost as toil, and \noften.enough as “worthy of the sweat of the noble”—but not in the \nleast as something light, divine, closely related to dancing and high \nspirits. “Thinking” and taking a matter “seriously,” considering it \n“prave”—for them all this belongs together: that is the only way \nthey have “experienced” it, \nArtists seem to have more sensitive noses in these matters, \n140 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nknowing only too well that precisely when they no longer do any- \n\n\nthing “voluntarily” but do everything of necessity, their feeling of \nfreedom, subtlety, full power, of creative placing, disposing, and \nforming reaches its peak—in short, that necessity and “freedom of \nthe will” then become one in them. \nUltimately, there is an order of rank among states of the soul, \nand the order of rank of problems accords with this.

It may be \ninteresting to compare Nietzsche's view with Dr. Thomas Stockmann’s in \nAct LV of Ibsen's An Enemy of the People: : , \n“What a difference there is between a cultivated and an uncultivated anis \nWE SCHOLARS 141 \nmal family!

Thus Stockmann says a little later: “But \nthat’s how it always goes when plebeian descent is still in one’s limbs and \none has not worked one’s way up to spiritual nobility. ...

The \npast of every form and way of life, of cultures that formerly lay \nright next to each other or one on top of the other, now flows into us \n“modern souls,” thanks to this mixture; our instincts now run back \neverywhere; we ourselves are a kind of chaos. Finally, as already \nmentioned, “the spirit” sees its advantage in this. \nThrough our semi-barbarism in body and desires we have \nsecret access in all directions, as no noble age ever did; above all, \naccess to the labyrinths of unfinished cultures and to every semi- \nbarbarism that ever existed on earth. And insofar as the most con- \nsiderable part of human culture so far was semi-barbarism, “his- \ntorical sense” almost means the sense and instinct for everything, \nthe taste and tongue for everything—which immediately proves it \nto be an ignoble sense. We enjoy Homer again, for example: per- \nhaps it is our most fortunate advantage that we know how to relish \nHomer whom the men of a noble culture (say, the French of the \nseventeenth century, like Saint-Evremond, who reproached him for \nhis esprit vaste, and even their afterglow, Voltaire) cannot and \ncould not assimilate so easily—whom to enjoy they scarcely per- \nmitted themselves. The very definite Yes and No of their- palate, \ntheir easy nausea, their hesitant reserve toward everything foreign, \ntheir horror of the poor taste even of a lively curiosity, and alto- \ngether the reluctance of every noble and self-sufficient culture to \nown a new desire, a dissatisfaction with what is one’s own, and ad- \n6 Vast or comprehensive spirit. \n152 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \n\n\nmiration for what is foreign—all this inclines and disposes them \nunfavorably even against the best things in the world which are not \ntheirs or could not become their prey. No sense is more incompre- \nhensible for such people than the historical sense and its submis- \nsive plebeian curiosity. \nIt is no different with Shakespeare, that amazing Spanish- \nMoorish-Saxon synthesis of tastes that would have all but killed an \nancient Athenian of Aeschylus’ circle with laughter or irritation. \nBut we—accept precisely this wild abundance of colors, this medley \nof what is most delicate, coarsest, and most artificial, with a secret \nfamiliarity and cordiality; we enjoy him as a superb subtlety of art \nsaved up especially for us; and the disgusting odors and the prox- \nimity of the English rabble in which Shakespeare’s art and taste live \nwe do not allow to disturb us any more than on the Chiaja of Na- \nples, where we go our way with all our senses awake, enchanted \nand willing, though the sewer smells of the plebeian quarters fill the \nair. \nAs men of the “historical sense” we also have our virtues; that \ncannot be denied: we are unpretentious, selfless, modest, coura- \ngeous, full of self-overcoming, full of devotion, very grateful, very \npatient, very accommodating; but for all that we are perhaps not \nparagons of good taste. Let us finally own it to ourselves: what we \nmen of the “historical sense” find most difficult to grasp, to feel, to \ntaste once more, to love once more, what at bottom finds us preju- \ndiced and almost hostile, is precisely the perfection and ultimate \nmaturity of every culture and art,’ that which is really noble in a \nwork or human being, the moment when their sea is smooth and \nthey have found halcyon self-sufficiency, the golden and cold as- \npect of all things that have consummated themselves, \nPerhaps our great virtue of the historical sense is necessarily \nopposed to good taste, at least to the very best taste; and precisely \nthe highest little strokes of luck and transfigurations of human life \nthat briefly light up here and there we can recapture only poorly, \n7 When Nietzsche wrote this, the taste for archaic and primitive art was \nnot yet widespread and classical art was still considered the norm: Praxi- \nteles and Raphael were supposed to be the ultimate in beauty. Nietzsche \nthus foresees developments of the twentieth century, \nOUR VIRTUES 153 \nhesitantly, by forcing ourselves—those moments and marvels when \n\n\ngreat power voluntarily stopped this side of the immeasurable and \nboundless, when an excess of subtle delight in sudden restraint and \npetrification, in standing firm and taking one’s measure, was en- \njoyed on still trembling ground. Measure is alien to us; let us own \nit; our thrill is the thrill of the infinite, the unmeasured. Like a rider \non a steed that flies forward, we drop the reins before the infinite, \nwe modern men, like semi-barbarians—and reach our bliss only \nwhere we are most—in danger."

Things still stand to- \nday as they have always stood: I see nobody in Europe who has \n(let alone, promotes) any awareness that thinking about morality \ncould become dangerous, captious, seductive—that there might be \nany calamity involved. \nConsider, for example, the indefatigable, inevitable British \nutilitarians, how they walk clumsily and honorably in Bentham’s \nfootsteps, walking along (a Homeric simile says it more plainly), \neven as he himself had already walked in the footsteps of the hon- \norable Helvetius'?

A secret fight \nagainst a bad conscience is not lacking either, as it is only fair that a \nrace of former Puritans will have a bad conscience whenever it tries \nto deal with morality scientifically.

Let us immediately add \nthat she also loses taste, She unlearns her fear of man: but the \nwoman who “unlearns fear” surrenders her most womanly instincts. \n81 Fortunately for Nietzsche, this is surely wrong. But it is worth asking \nwhich, if any, of his other ideas are of a piece with his secondhand wisdom \nabout “woman”: probably his embarrassingly frequent invocation of “sev- \nerity” and “hardness” and other such terms—the almost ritual repetition of \nthe words, not necessarily, if at all, the spiritualized conceptions he develops \nwith their aid—and perhaps also the tenor of his remarks about democracy \nand parliaments, Goethe said: “The greatest human beings are always con- \nnected with their century by means of some weakness” (Elective Affinities). \nAt these points Nietzsche's deliberate *untimeliness” now seems time-bound, \ndated, and as shallow as what he attacked, \n168 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nThat woman ventures forth when the aspect of man that in- \nspires fear—let us say more precisely, when the man in man is no \nlonger desired and cultivated—that is fair enough, also compre- \nhensible enough.

The German drags his soul along: \nwhatever he experiences he drags, He digests his events badly, he \nnever gets “done” with them; German profundity is often merely a \nhard and sluggish “digestion.” And just as all chronic invalids, all \ndyspeptics, love comfort, Germans love “openness” and “Bieder- \nkeit”: how comfortable it is to be open and “bieder”? 10 \nPerhaps the German of today knows no more dangerous and \nsuccessful disguise than this confiding, accommodating, cards-on- \nFor the eyes. \n10 The word has no exact English equivalent but might be rendered “four \nsquare,” \n180 BEYOND 000D AND EVIL \nthe-table manner of German honesty: this is his true Mephistopheles- \nart; with that he can “still go far.” The German lets himself go \nwhile making faithful blue, empty, German eyes—and immediately \nforeigners confound him with his dressing gown. \nI meant to say: whatever “German profundity” may be— \nwhen we are entirely among ourselves, perhaps we permit our- \nselves to laugh at it?—-we shall do well to hold its semblance and \ngood name in honor in the future, too, and not to trade our old \nreputation as a people of profundity too cheaply for Prussian \n“pluck” and Berlin wit and sand.™ It is clever for a people to make \n\n\nand let itself be considered profound, awkward, good-natured, hon- \nest, and not clever: it might even be—profound.

Beethoven was after all merely the final chord of transition in \nstyle, a style break, and not, like Mozart, the last chord of a \ncenturies-old great European taste. \nBeethoven is the interlude of a mellow old soul that con- \nstantly breaks and an over-young future soul that constantly comes; \non his music lies that twilight of eternal losing and eternal extrava- \ngant hoping—the same light in which Europe was bathed when it \n11 The area around Berlin was at one time called “the sandbox of the Holy \nRoman Empire.” \n12 This is by no meuns the accepted German etymology of deutsch, \nPEOPLES AND FATHERLANDS 181 \ndreamed with Rousseau, danced around the freedom tree of the \nRevolution, and finally almost worshiped before Napoleon. But how \nquickly this feeling pales now; how difficult is mere knowledge of \nthis feeling even today—how strange to our ears sounds the lan- \nguage of Rousseau, Schiller, Shelley, Byron, in whom, taken 10- \ngether, the same fate of Europe found its way into words that in \nBeethoven knew how to sing! \nWhatever German music came after that belongs to roman- \nticism, a movement that was, viewed historically, still briefer, still \nmore fleeting, still more superficial than that great entr’acte, that \ntransition of Europe from Rousseau to Napoleon and to the rise of \ndemocracy. Weber: but what are Freischiitz and Oberor to us to- \n\n\nday! Or Marschner’s Hans Heiling and Vampyr! Or even Wagner’s \nTannhäuser. That is music that has died away though it is not yet \nforgotten, All this music of romanticism, moreover, was not noble \nenough to remain valid anywhere except in the theater and before \ncrowds; it was from the start second-rate music that was not con= \nsidered seriously by genuine musicians, \nIt is different with Felix Mendelssohn, that halcyon master \nwho, on account of his lighter, purer, more enchanted soul, was \nhonored quickly and just as quickly forgotten: as the beautiful in- \ntermezzo of German music, But as for Robert Schumann, who was \nvery serious and also was taken seriously from the start—he was \nthe last to found a school—is it not considered a good fortune \namong us today, a relief, a liberation, that this Schumann romanti- \ncism has been overcome? \nSchumann, fleeing into the “Saxon Switzerland” 18 of his soul, \nhalf like Werther, half like Jean Paul, certainly not like Beethoven, \ncertainly not like Byron—his Manfred music is a mistake and mis- \nunderstanding to the point of an injustice—Schumann with his \ntaste which was basically a small taste (namely, a dangerous \npropensity, doubly dangerous among Germans, for quiet lyricism \nand sottishness of feeling), constantly walking off to withdraw shyly \nBA very rugged and picturesque mountain range about fifteen miles south- \neast of Dresden, not comparable in height, extent, or magnificence to tho \nSwiss Alps, \n182 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nand retire, a noble tender-heart who wallowed in all sorts of anony- \nmous bliss and woe, a kind of girl and noli me tangere’? from the \nstart: this Schumann was already a merely German event in music, \nno longer a European one, as Beethoven was and, to a still greater \nextent, Mozart.

A mis- \nunderstanding about its tempo, for rn the sentence it- \nself is misunderstood. \nThat one must not be in doubt about the rhythmically deci- \nsive syllables, that one experiences the break with any excessively \nsevere symmetry as deliberate and attractive, that one lends a sub- \ntle and patient ear to every staccato? and every rubato,1° that one \nfigures out the meaning in the sequence of vowels and diphthongs \nand how delicately and richly they can be colored and change \ncolors as they follow each other—who among book-reading Ger- \nmans has enough good will to acknowledge such duties and de- \nmands and to listen to that much art and purpose in language?

In antiquity men \nread—when they did read, which happened rarely enough—to \nthemselves, aloud, with a resounding voice; one was surprised \n\n\nwhen anyone read quietly, and secretly asked oneself for the rea- \nsons. With a resounding voice: that means, with all the crescendos, \ninflections, and reversals of tone and changes in tempo in which \nthe ancient public world took delight, \nThe laws of written style were then the same as those for \nspoken style; and these laws depended partly on the amazing de- \nvelopment and the refined requirements of ear and larynx, partly \non the strength, perseverance, and power of ancient Jungs. A pe- \nriod in the classical sense is above all a physiological unit, insofar \nas it is held together by a single breath. Such periods as are found \nin Demosthenes and Cicero, swelling twice and coming down \ntwice, all within a single breath, are delights for the men of an- \ntiquity who, from their own training, knew how to esteem their vit- \ntue and how rare and difficult was the delivery of such a period. \nWe really have no right to the great period, we who are modern \nand in every sense short of breath.?® \n17 The second master is surely Nietzsche, and the whole passage may give \nsome idea of the difficulty of translating him. \n18 In the first two editions this appears as 247a, although there is no section \ns \n1% But Beyond Good and Evil is full of examples, most of which have been \n184 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nAll of these ancients were after all themselves dilettantes in \nrhetoric, hence connoisseurs, hence critics and thus drove their \nthetoricians to extremes; just as in the last century, when all \nItalians and Italiennes knew how to sing, virtuosity in singing \n(and with that also the art of melody) reached its climax among \nthem. In Germany, however, there really was (until quite re- \ncently, when a kind of platform eloquence began shyly and clum- \nsily enough to flap its young wings) only a single species of public \nand roughly artful rhetoric: that from the pulpit. \nIn Germany the preacher alone knew what a syllable weighs, \nor a word, and how a sentence strikes, leaps, plunges, runs, runs \nout; he alone had a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad con- \nscience; for there is no lack of reasons why Germans rarely attain \nproficiency in rhetoric, and almost always too late. The masterpiece \n\n\nof German prose is therefore, fairly enough, the masterpiece of its \ngreatest preacher: the Bible has so far been the best German book. \nCompared with Luther’s Bible, almost everything else is mere “lit- \nerature”-—something that did not grow in Germany and there- \nfore also did not grow and does not grow into German hearts—as \nthe Bible did,"

First, the capacity for artistic passions, for \nthat devotion to “form” for which the phrase Part pour l'art has \nbeen invented along with a thousand others: that sort of thing has \nnot been lacking in France for the last three centuries and has \nmade possible again and again, thanks to their reverence for the \n“small number,” a kind of chamber music in literature for which \none looks in vain in the rest of Europe. \nThe second thing on which the French can base a superiority \nover Europe is their old, manifold, moralistic®? culture, as a result of \nwhich we find, on the average, even in the little romanciers of the \nnewspapers and in chance boulevardiers de Paris a psychological \noversensitivity and curiosity of which in Germany, for example, \none simply has no idea (let alone the thing itself). For this the Ger- \nmans lack a few centuries of moralistic work which, as mentioned, \nFrance did not spare herself; anyone who calls the Germans \n“naive” on that account praises them for a defect. (By way of con- \n\n\ntrast to the German inexperience and innocence in voluptate psy- \nchologica,*® which is none too distantly related to the tediousness of \n88 Modern soul, \n37 The negative overtones of “moralistic” in current English usage are out \nof place in this context; Nietzsche is plainly thinking of the French term \nmoraliste, \n38 In the delight of psychology. \n194 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nGerman company, and as the most consummate expression of a \ntypically French curiosity and inventiveness for this realm of deli- \ncate thrills, one may consider Henri Beyle,®* that remarkable an- \nticipatory and precursory human being who ran with a Napoleonic \ntempo through Ais Europe, through several centuries of the Euro- \npean soul, as an explorer and discoverer of this soul: it required \ntwo generations to catch up with him in any way, to figure out \nagain a few of the riddles that tormented and enchanted him, this \nodd epicurean and question mark of a man who was France’s last \ngreat psychologist. ) \nThere is yet a third claim to superiority. The French character \ncontains a halfway successful synthesis of the north and the south \nwhich allows them to comprehend many things and to do things \nwhich an Englishman could never understand. Their temperament, \nperiodically turned toward and away from the south, in which from \ntime to time Provençal and Ligurian blood foams- over, protects \nthem against the gruesome northern gray on gray and the sunless \nconcept-spooking and anemia—the disease of German taste \nagainst whose excesses one has now prescribed for oneself, with \nconsiderable resolution, blood and iron,*° which means “great poli- \ntics” (in accordance with a dangerous healing art which teaches me \nto wait and wait but so far has not taught me any hope.)

The noble \nhuman being separates from himself those in whom the opposite of \nsuch exalted, proud states finds expression: he despises them. It \nshould be noted immediately that in this first type of morality the \nopposition of “good” and “bad” means approximately the same as \n“noble” and “contemptible.” (The opposition of “good” and “evil” \nhas a different origin.) One feels contempt for the cowardly, the \n4 While the ideas developed here, and explicated at greater length a year \nlater in the first part of the Genealogy of Morals, had been expressed by \nNietzsche in 1878 in section 45 of Human, All-Too-Human, this is the pas- \nsage in which his famous terms “master morality” and “slave morality” are \nintroduced. \n5 These crucial qualifications, though added immediately, have often been \noverlooked. “Modern” moralities are clearly mixtures; hence their manifold \ntensions, hypocrisies, and contradictions, \nWHAT 15 NOBLE 205 \nanxious, the petty, those intent on narrow utility; also for the sus- \npicious with their unfree glances, those who humble themselves, the \ndoglike people who allow themselves to be maltreated, the begging \nflatterers, above all the liars: it is part of the fundamental faith of \nall aristocrats that the common people lie, “We truthful ones”— \nthus the nobility of ancient Greece referred to itself. \nIt is obvious that moral designations were everywhere first ap- \nplied to human beings and only later, derivatively, to actions. \nTherefore it is a gross mistake when historians of morality start \n\n\nfrom such questions as: why was the compassionate act praised? \nThe noble type of man experiences itself as determining values; it \ndoes not need approval; it judges, “what is harmful to me is harm- \nful in itself”; it knows itself to be that which first accords honor to \nthings; it is value-creating. Everything it knows as part of itself it \nhonors: such a morality is self-glorification,.In the foreground there \nis the feeling of fullness, of power that seeks to overflow, the happi- \nness of high tension, the consciousness of wealth that would give \nand bestow: the noble human being, too, helps the unfortunate, but \nnot, or almost not, from pity, but prompted more by an urge be- \ngotten by excess of power. The noble human being honors himself \nas one who is powerful, also as one who has power over himself, \nwho knows how to speak and be silent, who delights in being severe \nand hard with himself and respects all severity and hardness. “A \nhard heart Wotan put into my breast,” says an old Scandinavian \nsaga: a fitting poetic expression, seeing that it comes from the soul \nof a proud Viking. Such a type of man is actually proud of the fact \nthat he is not made for pity, and the hero of the saga therefore adds \nas a warning: “If the heart is not hard in youth it will never \nharden.” Noble and courageous human beings who think that way \nare furthest removed from that morality which finds the distinction \nof morality precisely in pity, or in acting for others, or in desinte= \nressement; faith in oneself, pride in oneself, a fundamental hostility \nand irony against “selflessness” belong just as definitely to noble \nmorality as does a slight disdain and caution regarding compas- \nsionate feelings and a “warm heart.” \nIt is the powerful who understand how to honor; this is their \nart, their realm of invention. The profound reverence for age and \n206 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \ntradition—all law rests on this double reverence—the faith and \nprejudice in favor of ancestors and disfavor of those yet to come are \ntypical of the morality of the powerful; and when the men of \n“modern ideas,” conversely, believe almost instinctively in “prog- \nress” and “the future” and more and more lack respect for age, this \nin itself would sufficiently betray the ignoble origin of these “ideas.” \nA morality of the ruling group, however, is most alien and em- \nbarrassing to the present taste in the severity of its principle that \none has duties only to one’s peers; that against beings of a lower \nrank, against everything alien, one may behave as one pleases or \n“as the heart desires,” and in any case “beyond good and evil’— \nhere pity and like feelings may find their place.® The capacity for, \nand the duty of, long gratitude and long revenge-——both only among \none’s peers—refinement in repaying, the sophisticated concept of \nfriendship, a certain necessity for having enemies (as it were, as \n\n\ndrainage ditches for the affects of envy, quarrelsomeness, exuber- \nance—at bottom, in order to be capable of being good friends): all \nthese are typical characteristics of noble morality which, as sug- \ngested, is not the morality of “modern ideas” and therefore is hard \nto empathize with today, also hard to dig up and uncover.” \n6 The final clause that follows the dash, omitted in the Cowan translation, is \ncrucial and qualifies the first part of the sentence: a noble person has no \nduties to animals but treats them in accordance with his feelings, which \nmeans, if he is noble, with pity. \nThe ruling masters, of course, are not always noble in this sense, and this \nis recognized by Nietzsche in Twilight of the Idols, in the chapter “The ‘Im- \nprovers’ of Mankind,” in which he gives strong expression to his distaste for \nManu’s laws concerning outcastes (Portable Nietzsche, pp. 503-05); also in \nThe Will to Power (ed. W. Kaufmann, New York, Random House, 1967), \nsection 142. Indeed, in The Antichrist, section 57, Nietzsche contradicts out- \nright his formulation above: “When the exceptional human being treats the \nmediocre more tenderly than himself and his peers, this is not mere courtesy \nof the heart—it is simply his duty.” \nMore important: Nietzsche's obvious distaste for slave morality and the \nfact that he makes a point of liking master morality better does not imply \nthat he endorses master morality. Cf. the text for note 5 above. \n7 Clearly, master morality cannot be discovered by introspection nor by the \nobservation of individuals who are “masters” rather than “slaves.” Both \nof these misunderstandings are widespread, What is called for is rather a \nrereading of, say, the Zliad and, to illustrate “slave morality,” the New \nTestament, \nWHAT IS NOBLB 207 \nIt is different with the second type of morality, slave morality. \nSuppose the violated, oppressed, suffering, unfree, who are uncer« \ntain of themselves and weary, moralize: what will their moral valu- \nations have in common? Probably, a pessimistic suspicion about the \nwhole condition of man will find expression, perhaps a condemna- \ntion of man along with his condition. The slave’s eye is not favora- \nble to the virtues of the powerful: he is skeptical and suspicious, \nsubtly suspicious, of all the “good” that is honored there-—he \nwould like to persuade himself that even their happiness is not \ngenuine, Conversely, those qualities are brought out and flooded \nwith light which serve to ease existence for those who suffer: here \npity, the complaisant and obliging hand, the warm heart, patience, \nindustry, humility, and friendliness are honored—for here these \nare the most useful qualities and almost the only means for endur- \n\n\ning the pressure of existence. Slave morality is essentially a morality \nof utility. \nHere is the place for the origin of that famous opposition of \n“good” and “evil”: into evil one’s feelings project power and dan- \ngerousness, a certain terribleness, subtlety, and strength that does \nnot permit contempt to develop, According to slave morality, those \nwho are “evil” thus inspire fear; according to master morality it is \nprecisely those who are “good” that inspire, and wish to inspire, \nfear, while the “bad” are felt to be contemptible, \nThe opposition reaches its climax when, as a logical conse- \nquence of slave morality, a touch of disdain is associated also with \nthe “good” of this morality—this may be slight and benevolent— \nbecause the good human being has to be undangerous in the slaves’ \nway of thinking: he is good-natured, easy to deceive, a little stupid \nperhaps, un bonhomme $ Wherever slave morality becomes pre- \nponderant, language tends to bring the words “good” and “stupid” \ncloser together, \nOne last fundamental difference: the longing for freedom, \nthe instinct for happiness and the subtleties of the feeling of free- \n8 Literally “a good human being,” the term is used for precisely the type \ndescribed here. \n208 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \ndom belong just as necessarily to slave morality and morals as art- \nful and enthusiastic reverence and devotion are the regular symp- \ntom of an aristocratic way of thinking and evaluating. \nThis makes plain why love as passion—which is our Euro- \npean specialty—simply must be of noble origin: as is well known, \nits invention must be credited to the Provençal knight-poets, those \nmagnificent and inventive human beings of the “gat saber”? to \nwhom Europe owes so many things and almost owes itself.—"

Cf. section 260, note 9. \n41 Translated into English from Nietzsche's German, Though the words \nappear in quotation marks, there seem to be only five passages in which \nHobbes discusses laughter—never in quite these words, (Two of these are \nfound in the Latin works and add nothing to the quotations that follow.) \nHobbes explained laughter by invoking the will to power, albeit without \nusing that term. \nThe first and longest discussion is found in Human Nature (1640), \nChapter IX.13: “There is a passion that hath no name; but the sign of it is \nthat distortion of the countenance which we call /aughter, which is always \njoy... . Whatsoever it be that moveth to laughter, it must be new and \nunexpected, Men laugh often, especially such as are greedy of applause \nfrom every thing they do well, at their own actions performed never so \nlittle beyond their own expectations; as also at their own jests: and in this \n\n\ncase it is manifest, that the passion of laughter proceedeth from a sudden \nconception of some ability in himself that laugheth. Also men laugh at the \ninfirmities of others, by comparison wherewith their own abilities are set off \nand illustrated. Also men laugh at jests, the wit whereof always consisteth \nin the elegant discovering and conveying to our minds some absurdity of \nanother: and in this case also the passion of laughter proceedeth from the \nsudden imagination of our own odds and eminency, .. . For when a jest \nis broken upon ourselves, or friends of whose dishonour we participate, we \nnever laugh thereat. | may therefore conchide, that the passion of laughter \nis nothing else but sudden glory arising from some sudden conception of \nsome eminency in ourselves, by comparison with the infirmity of others, or \n232 BEYOND GOOD AND BVIL \nI should actually risk an order of rank among philosophers de- \npending on the rank of their laughter—all the way up to those ca- \npable of golden laughter, And supposing that gods, too, philoso- \nphize, which has been suggested to me by many an inference—I \nwith our own formerly: for men laugh at the follies of themselves past . . « \nBesides, it is vain glory, and an argument of little worth, to think the in- \nfirmity of another, sufficient matter for his triumph.” \nThe parallel passage in the Leviathan (1651), Part I, Chapter 6, p. 27, \nwhich is much shorter, ends: “And it is incident most to them, that are con- \nscious of the fewest abilities in themselves; who are forced to keep them- \nselves in their own favour, by observing the imperfections of other men, \nAnd therefore much Laughter at the defects of others is a signe of Pusillani- \nmity. For of great minds, one of the proper workes is, to help and free \nothers from scorn; and compare themselves onely with the most able.” \nFinally, in “The Answer of Mr. Hobbes to Sir William Davenant's \nPreface before Gondibert” (Paris, Jan. 10, 1650; reprinted in The English \nWarks of Thomas Hobbes, vol. IV, 1840) Hobbes says (pp. 454£.): “Great \npersons, that have their minds employed on great designs, have not leisure \nenough to laugh, and are pleased with the contemplation of their own \npower and virtues, so as they need not the infirmities and vices of other men \nto recommend themselves to their own favour by comparison, as all men do \nwhen they laugh.” \nHobbes is evidently thinking quite literally of laughter while for \nNietzsche laughter represents an attitude toward the world, toward life, and \ntoward oneself. In The Gay Science (1882) he had written: “Laughter \nmeans: to rejoice at another's expense [schadenfroh sein], but with a good \nconscience” (section 200). And still earlier, in Human, All-Too-Human \n(1878): “Descending below the animals.— When man neighs with laughter, \nhe surpasses all animals by his vulgarity\" (section 553). But in the second \n\n\nvolume of the same work (1879) we find an aphorism (section 173): \n“Laughing and smiling.— The more joyous and certain his spirit becomes, \nthe more man unlearns loud laughter; instead a more spiritual smile con- \nstantly wells up in him. . . .\" And in a note of that period (Musarion edi- \ntion, IX, 413): “Everything sudden pleases if it does no harm; hence wit. \n«.. For a tension is thus released. . . .” And another note (same page): \n“Caricature is the beginning of art. That something signifies, delights, That \nwhatever signifies, should mock and be laughed at, delights still more. \nLaughing at something is the first sign of a higher psychic life (as in the \nfine arts).” \nIn spite of the title The Gay Science, Nietzsche's celebration of laughter \nis encountered first and foremost in Zarathustra, To cite all the relevant pas- \nsages (Portable Nietzsche pp. 248, 272, 294, 310, 341, 342, 427) would be \npointless, but the three most significant should be mentioned, ty \n“Not by wrath does one kill but by laughter. Come, let us kill the spirit \nof gravity!” (“On Reading and Writing,” p. 153), i \n“As yet he has not learned laughter or beauty, Gloomy this hunter re- \nturned from the woods of knowledge... . But I do not like these tense \nsouls, .. . As yet his knowledge has not learned to smile. . a e Gracefulness \nWHAT IS NOBLB 233 \nshould not doubt that they also know how to laugh the while in \na superhuman and new way—and at the expense of all serious \nthings.

Cornford translation). \nWHAT IS NOBLB 235 \nborn—as the last, it seems to me, who offered him a sacrifice: for 1 \nhave found no one who understood what I was doing then.** \nMeanwhile I have learned much, all too much, more about \nthe philosophy of this god, and, as I said, from mouth to mouth-—~ \nI, the last disciple and initiate of the god Dionysus—and I sup- \npose I might begin at long last to offer you, my friends, a few tastes \nof this philosophy, insofar as this is permitted to me? In an under- \ntone, as is fair, for it concerns much that is secret, new, strange, \nodd, uncanny, \nEven that Dionysus is a philosopher, and that gods, too, thus \ndo philosophy, seems to me to be a novelty that is far from innocu- \nous and might arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers, \nAmong you, my friends, it will not seem so offensive, unless it \ncomes too late and not at the right moment; for today, as I have \nbeen told, you no longer like to believe in God and gods, Perhaps I \nshall also have to carry frankness further in my tale than will al- \nways be pleasing to the strict habits of your ears? Certainly the \ngod in question went further, very much further, in dialogues of \n\n\nthis sort and was always many steps ahead of me, \nIndeed, if it were permitted to follow human custom in ac- \ncording to him many solemn pomp-and-virtue names, I should \nhave to give abundant praise to his explorer and discoverer cour- \nage, his daring honesty, truthfulness, and love of wisdom. But \nsuch a god has no use whatever for all such venerable junk and \npomp. “Keep that,” he would say, “for yourself and your likes and \n#4 Although “first-born” is plural in the original (Erstlinge), the primary \nreference is certainly to The Birth of Tragedy . From the Preface added to \nthe new edition of 1886 (the same ycar that saw the publication of Beyond \nGood and Evil) it is plain that by now Nietzsche felt that he himself had \nnot fully understood in 1872 what he was doing. \nMore important: the Dionysus of his later works is no longer the \nDionysus of The Birth of Tragedy, In the early work, Dionysus stands for \nuncontrolled, frenzied, intoxicated passion and is contrasted with Apollo; in \nthe later works, Dionysus stands for controlled and creatively employed \nassion—the mature Goethe is now called Dionysian (Twilight, section 49, \nortable Nietzsche, ir 553£.)—and is contrasted with “the Crucified” (end \nof = Homo) and the extirpation of the passions and the denial of this \nworld, \n236 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nwhoever else has need of it! I—have no reason for covering my \nnakedness.” \nOne guesses: this type of deity and philosopher is perhaps \nJacking in shame? \nThus he once said: “Under certain circumstances I love what \nis human”—and with this he alluded to Ariadne who was present*® \n-—“‘man is to my mind an agreeable, courageous, inventive ani- \nmal that has no equal on earth; it finds its way in any labyrinth. I \nam well disposed towards him: I often reflect how 1 might yet ad- \nvance him and make him stronger, more évil, and more profound \nthan he is.” \n“Stronger, more evil, and more profound?” I asked startled. \n“Yes,” he said once more; “stronger,- more evil, and more pro- \nfound; also more beautiful’—and at that the tempter god smiled \nwith his halcyon smile as though he had just paid an enchanting \ncompliment. Here we also see; what this divinity lacks is not only a \n\n\nsense of shame—and there are also other good reasons for con- \njecturing that in several respects all of the gods could learn from \nus humans, We humans are—more humane.**—~"
