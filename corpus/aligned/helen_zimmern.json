A httle more strength, swing, courage, and \nartistic power, and they would be o§ — and not back! \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL ii \nI \nIX \nIt seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at \npresent to divert attention from the actual influence which \nKant exercised on German philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon himself. Kant \n\n\nwas first and foremost proud of his Table of Categories; \nwith it in his hand he said: \"This is the most difficult thing \nthat could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.\" \nLet us only understand this \"could be\"! He was proud of \nhaving discovered a new faculty in man, the faculty of \nsynthetic judgment a priori. Granting that he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid flourishing \nof German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, \nand on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible something — at all events \"new faculties\" — \nof which to be still prouder! — But let us reflect for a \nmoment — it is high time to do so. \"How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?\" Kant asks himself — and what is \nreally his answer? \"By means of a means (faculty)\" — ^but \nunfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly, and with such display of German profimdity and \nverbal flourishes, that one altogether loses sight of the \ncomical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer. People were beside themselves with delight over this new fac^ ulty, and the jubilation reached its chmeix v/hen Kant further \ndiscovered a moral faculty in man — for at that time Germans \nwere still moral, not yet dabbhng in the \"Pohtics of hard \nfact.\" Then came the honeymoon of German philosophy. \nAll the young theologians of the Tiibingen institution went \nI mmediately into the groves — all seeking for \"faculties.\" \njri .tod what did they not find — in that innocent, rich, and still \nII \n12 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nyouthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, \nthe mahcious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet \ndistinguish between \"finding\" and \"inventing\"! Above all \na faculty for the \"transcendental\"; Schelhng christened it, \nintellectual intuition, and thereby gratified the most eamest \nlongings of the naturally pious-inclined Germans. One can \ndo no greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness, notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly in hoary and senile \nconceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with \nmoral indignation. Enough, however — the world grew older, \nand the dream vanished. A time came when people rubbed \ntheir foreheads, and they still rub them to-day. People had \nbeen dreaming, and first and foremost — old Kant. \"By \nmeans of a means (faculty)\" — he had said, or at least meant \nto say. But, is that — an answer? An explanation? Or \n\n\nis it not rather merely a repetition of the question? How \ndoes opium induce sleep? \"By means of a means (faculty),\" \nnamely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in Mohere, \nQuia est in eo virtus dormitiva, \nCujus est natura sensus assoupire. \nBut such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is \nhigh time to replace the Kantian question, \"How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?\" by another question, \n\"Why is belief in such judgments necessary?\" — in effect, it \nhigh time that we should imderstand that such judgments, \nmust be believed to be true, for the sake of the preservation of creatures hke ourselves; though they still might] \nnaturally be false judgments! Or, more plainly spokeUjj \nand roughly and readily — synthetic judgments a priori shoulc \nnot \"be possible\" at all; we have no right to them; in oui \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 13 \nmouths they are nothing but false judgments). Only, of \ncourse, the belief in their truth is necessary, as plausible \nbelief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view \nof life. And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence \nwhich \"German philosophy\" — I hope you understand its \nright to inverted commas (gooseteet)? — has exercised \nthroughout the whole of Europe, there is no doubt that a \ncertain virtus dormitiva had a share in it; thanks to German \nphilosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous, \nthe mystics, the artists, the three- fourths Christians, and the \npohtical obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to \nthe still overwhelming sensuahsm which overflowed from \nthe last century into this, in short — \"sensus assoupire.\" . . . \ny2 \nAs regards materiahstic atomism, it is one of the best \nrefuted theories that have been advanced, and in Europe \nthere is now perhaps no one in the leamed world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it, except for \nconvenient everyday use (as an abbreviation of the means \nof expression) — thanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he \nand the Pole Copemicus have hitherto been the greatest and \nmost successful opponents of ocular evidence. For whilst \nCopemicus has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the \nsenses, that the earth does not stand fast, Boscovich has \ntaught us to abjure the belief in the last thing that \"stood \n\n\nfast\" of the earth — the belief in \"substance,\" in \"matter,\" \nin the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest \ntriumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on \nearth. One must, however, go still further, and also declare \nwar, relentless war to the knife, against the \"atomistic requirements\" which still lead a dangerous after-life in places \n14 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nwhere no one suspects them, hke the more celebrated \"metaphysical requirements\": one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism \nwhich Christianity has taught best and longest, the soulatomism. Let it be permitted to designate by this expression \nthe belief which regards the soul as something indestructible, \netemal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief \nought to be expelled from science! Between ourselves, it is \nnot at all necessary to get rid of \"the soul\" thereby, and thus \nrenounce one of the oldest and most venerated hj^otheses — \nas happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturahsts, who \ncan hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it. \nBut the way is open for new acceptations and refinements of \nthe soul-hypothesis; and such conceptions as \"mortal soul,\" \nand \"soul of subjective multiphcity,\" and \"soul as social \nstructure of the instincts and passions,\" want henceforth to \nhave legitimate rights in science. In that the new psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have \nhitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the \nidea of the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into \na new desert and a new distrust — it is possible that the older \npsychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of \nit; eventually, however, he finds that precisely thereby he \nis also condemned to invent — and, who knows? perhaps to \ndiscover the new."

Only that which can be seen and felt — one \nmust pursue every problem thus far. Obversely, however, \nthe charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an \naristocratic mode, consisted precisely in resistance to obvious \nsense-evidence — perhaps among men who enjoyed even \nstronger and more fastidious senses than our contemporaries, \nbut who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining \nmasters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional networks which they threw over the motley whirl \nof the senses — the mob of the senses, as Plato said. In this \novercoming of the world, and interpreting of the world in \nthe manner of Plato, there was an enjoyment different from \nthat which the physicists of to-day offer us — and hkewise \nthe Darwinists and antiteleologists among the physiological \n1 6 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nworkers, with their principle of the \"smallest possible effort,\" \nand the greatest possible blunder. \"Where there is nothing \nmore to see or to grasp, there is also nothing more for men \nto do\" — that is certainly an imperative different from the \nPlatonic one, but it may notwithstanding be the right imperative for a hardy, labourious race of machinists and \nbridge-builders of the future, who have nothing but rough \nwork to perform. \nIS \nTo study physiology with a clear conscience, one must \ninsist on the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in \nthe sense of the ideahstic philosophy; as such they certainly \ncould not be causes! Sensuahsm, therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis, if not as heuristic principle. What? And \n\n\nothers say even that the extemal world is the work of our \norgans? But then our body, as a part of this extemal world, \nwould be the work of our organs! But then our organs \nthemselves would be the work of our organs! It seems to \nme that this is a complete reductio ad absurdum, if the conception causa sui is something fundamentally absurd. Consequently, the extemal world is not the work of our organs — ? \ni6 \nThere are still harmless self-observers who believe that \nthere are \"immediate certainties\"; for instance, \"I think,\" \nor as the superstition of Schopenhauer puts it, \"I will\"; as \nthough cognition here got hold of its object purely and simply \nas \"the thing in itself,\" without any falsification taking place \neither on the part of the subject or the object. I would \nrepeat it, however, a hundred times, that \"immediate cerBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 17 \ntainty,\" as well as \"absolute knowledge\" and the \"thing in \nitself,\" involve a contradictio in adjecto; we really ought to \nfree ourselves from the misleading significance of words! \nThe people on their part may think that cognition is knowing \nall about things, but the philosopher must say to himself: \n\"When I analyse the process that is expressed in the sentence, 'I think,' I find a whole series of daring assertions, the \nargumentative proof of which would be difficult, perhaps \nimpossible: for instance, that it is / who think, that there \nmust necessarily be something that thinks, that thinking is \nan activity and operation on the part of a being who is \nthought of as a cause, that there is an 'ego,' and finally, that \nit is already determined what is to be designated by thinking \n— that I know what thinking is. For if I had not already \ndecided within myself what it is, by what standard could I \ndetermine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps \n'wilhng' or 'feehng'? In short, the assertion 'I think,' assumes that I compare my state at the present moment with \nother states of myself which I know, in order to determine \nwhat it is; on accoimt of this retrospective connection with \nfurther 'knowledge,' it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for me.\" — In place of the \"immediate certainty\" in \nwhich the people may believe in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a series of ^netaphysical questions presented \nto him, veritable conscience questions of the intellect, to wit: \n\"From whence did I get the notion of 'thinking'? Why do \nI believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right to \nspeak of an 'ego,' and even of an 'ego' as cause, and finally \nof an 'ego' as cause of thought?\" He who ventures to answer these metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to \na sort of intuitive perception, hke the person who says, \"I \nthink, and know that this, at least, is true, actual, and certain\"— will encounter a smile and two notes of interrogation \n1 8 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nin a philosopher nowadays. \"Sir,\" the philosopher' will perhaps give him to understand, \"it is improbable that you are \nnot mistaken, but why should it be the truth?\""

      "text": "Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though \nit were the best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us to understand that the will alone is really \nknown to us, absolutely and completely known, without deduction or addition. But it again and again seems to me that \nin this case Schopenhauer also only did what philosophers are \nin the habit of doing — he seems to have adopted a popular \nprejudice and exaggerated it. Wilhng — seems to me to be \nabove all something complicated, something that is a unity \nonly in name — and it is precisely in a name that popular \nprejudice lurks, which has got the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages. So let us for \nonce be more cautious, let us be \"unphilosophical\": let us \nsay that in all wilhng there is firstly a plurahty of sensations, namely, the sensation of the condition \"away from \nwhich we go,\" the sensation of the condition \"towards which \nwe go,\" the sensation of this \"from\" and \"towards\" itself, \nand then besides, an accompanying muscular sensation, \nwhich, even without our putting in motion \"arms and legs,\" \ncommences its action by force of habit, directly we *'wiH\" \nanything. Therefore, just as sensations (and indeed many \nkinds of sensations) are to be recognised as ingredients of \nthe will, so, in the second place, thinking is also to be recognised; in every act of the will there is a ruhng thought; — \nand let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from \nthe \"wilhng,\" as if the will would then remain over! In the \n20 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nthird place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and \nthinking, but it is above all an emotion, and in fact the \nemotion of the command. That which is termed \"freedom \nof the will\" is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: \"I am free, 'he' must obey\" — \nthis consciousness is inherent in every will; and equally so \nthe straining of the attention, the straight look which fixes \nitself exclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment \nthat \"this and nothing else is necessary now,\" the inward \ncertainty that obedience will be rendered — and whatever else \npertains to the position of the commander. A man who wills \ncommands something within himself which renders obedience, \nor which he believes renders obedience. But now let us \nnotice what is the strangest thing about the will, — this affair \nso extremely complex, for which the people have only one \nname. Inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the \nsame time the commanding and the obeying parties, and as \nthe obe5dng party we know the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the \nother hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duahty, \nand to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic \nterm \"I\": a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false judgments about the will itself, has become attached to the act of wilhng — to such a degree that \nhe who wills believes firmly that wilhng suffices for action. \nSince fn the majority of cases there has only been exercise of \nwill when the effect of the command — consequently obedience, and therefore action — was to be expected, the appearance has translated itself into the sentiment, as if there were \na necessity of effect; in a word, he who wills believes with \na fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow \none; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the wilhng, \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 21 \nto the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success. \"Freedom of \nWill\" — that is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising vohtion, who commands and \nat the same time identifies himself with the executor of the \norder — who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, \nbut thinks within himself that it was really his own will \nthat overcame them. In this way the person exercising vohtion adds the feehngs of delight of his successful executive \ninstruments, the useful \"underwills\" or under-souls — indeed, \nour body is but a social structure composed of many souls — ■ \nto his feehngs of delight as commander. L'effet c'est mot: \nwhat happens here is what happens in every well-constructed \nand happy commonwealth, namely, that the goveming class \nidentifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth. In \nall wilhng it is absolutely a question of commanding and \nobeying, on the basis, as already said, of a social structure \ncomposed of many \"souls\"; on which account a philosopher \nshould claim the right to include wilhng-as-such within the \nsphere of morals — regarded as the doctrine of the relations \nof supremacy imder which the phenomenon of \"life\" manifests itself."

It is we alone who have devised cause, sequence^ \n24 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nreciprocity, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive, and purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this \nsymbol- world, as \"being in itself,\" with things, we act once \nmore as we have always acted — mythologically. The \"nonfree will\" is mythology; in real life it is only a question of \nstrong and weak wills. — It is almost always a symptom of \nwhat is lacking in himself, when a thinker, in every \"casualconnection\" and \"psychological necessity,\" manifests something of compulsion, indigence, obsequiousness, oppression, \nand non-freedom; it is suspicious to have such feehngs — the \nperson betrays himself. And in general, if I have observed \ncorrectly, the \"non-freedom of the will\" is regarded as a \nproblem from two entirely opposite standpoints, but always \nin a profoundly personal manner: some will not give up \ntheir \"responsibility,\" their belief in themselves, the personal \nright to their merits, at any price (the vain races belong to \nthis class) ; others on the contrary, do not wish to be answerable for anything, or blamed for anything, and owing to an \ninward self-contempt, seek to get out of the business, no \nmatter how. The latter, when they write books, are in the \nhabit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort of \nsociahstic sympathy is their favourite disguise. And as a \n\n\nmatter of fact, the fatahsm of the weak-willed embelhshes \nitself surprisingly when it can pose as \"la religion de la soufjrance humaine\"; that is its \"good taste.\""

Lessing is an excep- tion, owing to his histrionic nature, which understood much, and was versed in many things; he who was not the trans- lator of Bayle to no purpose, who took refuge willingly in the shadow of Diderot and Voltaire, and still more willingly among the Roman comedy-writers — Lessing loved also free- spiritism in the tempo, and flight out of Germany. But how could the German language, even in the prose of Lessing, imitate the tempo of Machiavelli, who in his \"Principe\" makes us breathe the dry, fine air of Florence, and cannot help presenting the most serious events in a boisterous alle- grissimo, perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he ventures to present — long, heavy, difficult, dangerous thoughts, and a tempo of the gallop, and of the best, wantonest humour?

A question worth asking! — \nit would be strange if some mystic has not already ventured \non the same kind of thing.

They are not the worst things \nof which one is most ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask — there is so much goodness in craft. I could \nimagine that a man with something costly and fragile to \nconceal, would roll through life clumsily and rotundly hke \nan old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of \nhis shame requiring it to be so. A man who has depths in \nhis shame meets his destiny and his dehcate decisions upon \npaths which few ever reach, and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate friends may \nbe ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from their eyes, \nand equally so his regained security. Such a hidden nature, \nwhich instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment, and is inexhaustible in evasion of communication, desires and insists that a mask of himself shall occupy his \nplace in the hearts and heads of his friends; and supposing \nhe does not desire it, his eyes will some day be opened to \nthe fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him there — and \nthat it is well to be so. Every profound spirit needs a mask; \nnay, more, around every profound spirit there continually \ngrows a mask, owing to the constantly false, that is to say, \nsuperficial interpretation of every word he utters, every step \nhe takes, every sign of life he manifests. \nII \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 47"

Perhaps everything on \nwhich the intellectual eye has exercised its acuteness and \nprofundity has just been an occasion for its exercise, something of a game, something for children and childish minds. \nPerhaps the most solemn conceptions that have caused the \nmost fighting and suffering, the conceptions \"God\" and \"sin,\" \nwill one day seem to us of no more importance than a child's \nplaything or a child's pain seems to an old man; — and perhaps another plaything and another pain will then be necessary once more for \"the old man\" — always childish enough, \nan etemal child! \nS8 \nHas it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or \n\n\nsemi-idleness, is necessary to a real religious life (ahke for \nits favourite microscopic labour of self-examination, and for \n.its soft placidity called \"prayer,\" the state of perpetual \nkreadiness for the \"coming of God\"), I mean the idleness with \n[a good conscience, the idleness of olden times and of blood, \nwhich the aristocratic sentiment that work is dishonouring \n\\ — that it vulgarises body and soul — is not quite unfamihar? \nid that consequently the modem, noisy, time-engrossing, \nsnceited, foolishly proud laboriousness educates and preires for \"unbelief\" more than anything else? Amongst \nlese, for instance, who are at present hving apart from \nigion in Germany, I find \"free-thinkers\" of diversified \n64 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nspecks and origin, but above all a majority of those in \nwhom laboriousness from generation to generation has dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no longer know \nwhat purpose religions serve, and only note their existence \nin the world with a kind of dull astonishment. They feel \nthemselves already fully occupied, these good people, be it \nby their business or by their pleasures, not to mention the \n'Tatherland,\" and the newspapers, and their \"family duties\"; it seems that they have no time whatever left for \nreligion; and above all, it is not obvious to them whether it \nis a question of a new business or a new pleasure — for it is \nimpossible, they say to themselves, that people should go to \nchurch merely to spwil their tempers. They are by no means \nenemies of religious customs; should certain circumstances, \nState affairs perhaps, require their participation in such customs, they do what is required, as so many things are done — \nwith a patient and unassuming seriousness, and without much \ncuriosity or discomfort; — they live too much apart and outside to feel even the necessity for a jor or against in such \nmatters. Among those indifferent persons may be reckoned \nnowadays the majority of German Protestants of the middle \nclasses, especially in the great laborious centres of trade and \ncommerce; also the majority of laborious scholars, and the \nentire University personnel (with the exception of the theologians, whose existence and possibility there always givesj \npsychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve), \nthe part of pious, or merely church-going people, there is \nseldom any idea of how much goodwill, one might say arbitrary will, is now necessary for a German scholar to take thej \nproblem of religion seriously; his whole profession (and as ij \n\n\nhave said, his whole workmanhke laboriousness, to which he \nis compelled by his modem conscience) inclines him to \nlofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion, wit \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 65 \nwhich is occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the \"uncleanhness\" of spirit which he takes for granted wherever \nany one still professes to belong to the Church. It is only \nwith the help of history {not through his own personal experience, therefore) that the scholar succeeds in bringing \nhimself to a respectful seriousness, and to a certain timid deference in presence of religions; but even when his sentiments \nhave reached the stage of gratitude towards them, he has not \npersonally advanced one step nearer to that which still maintains itself as Church or as piety; perhaps even the contrary. \nThe practical indifference to religious matters in the midst \nof which he has been bom and brought up, usually subhmates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanhness, \nwhich shuns contact with religious men and things; and it \nmay be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which \nprompts him to avoid the dehcate trouble which tolerance \nitself brings with it. — Every age has its own divine type of \nnaivete, for the discovery of which other ages may envy it: \nand how much naivete — adorable, childhke, and boundlessly \nfoolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in his \nsuperiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance, in the unsuspecting, simple certainty with which his instinct treats the \nreligious man as a lower and less valuable type, beyond, \nbefore, and above which he himself has developed — he, the \nhttle arrogant dwarf and mob-mem, the sedulously alert, \nhead-and-hand drudge of \"ideas,\" of \"modem ideas\"!"

It is the profound, suspicious fear of an incurable pessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten \ntheir teeth into a religious interpretation of existence: the \nfear of the instinct which divines that truth might be attained too soon, before man has become strong enough, hard \nenough, artist enough. . . . Piety, the \"Life in God,\" regarded in this light, would appear as the most elaborate and \nultimate product of the fear of truth, as artist-adoration and \nartist-intoxication in presence of the most logical of all falsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to imtruth at \nany price. Perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective \nmeans of beautifying man than piety; by means of it man \ncan become so artful, so superficial, so iridescent, and so \ngood, that his appearance no longer offends."

The \nselecting and disciphning influence — destructive, as well as \ncreative and fashioning — which can be exercised by means of \n\n\nreligion is manifold and varied, according to the sort of \npeople placed under its spell and protection. For those \nwho are strong and independent, destined and trained to \ncommand, in whom the judgment and skill of a ruhng race \nis incorporated, religion is an additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of authority — as a bond which \nbinds rulers and subjects in common, betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter, their inmost heart, which would fain escape obedience. And in the \ncase of the unique natures of noble origin, if by virtue of \niperior spirituality they should incline to a more retired and \n>ntemplative life, reserving to themselves only the more \nined forms of govemment (over chosen disciples or memers of an order), religion itself may be used as a means for \n)taining peace from the noise and trouble of managing \nrosser affairs, and for securing immxmity from the unavoid68 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nable filth of all pohtical agitation. The Brahmins, for instance, understood this fact. With the help of a religious \norganisation, they secured to themselves the power of nominating kings for the people, while their sentiments prompted \nthem to keep apart and outside, as men with a higher zind \nsuper-regal mission. At the same time religion gives inducement and opportunity to some of the subjects to quahfy \nthemselves for future ruhng and commanding: the slowly \nascending ranks and classes, in which, through fortimate \nmarriage customs, vohtional power and delight in self-control \nare on the increase. To them religion offers sufficient incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuahty, and \nto experience the sentiments of authoritative self-control, of \nsilence, and of sohtude. Asceticism and Puritanism are \nalmost indispensable means of educating and ennobhng a \nrace which seeks to rise above its hereditary baseness and \nwork itself upward to future supremacy. And finally, to \nordinary men, to the majority of the people, who exist for \nservice and general utihty, and are only so far entitled to \nexist, religion gives invaluable contentedness with their lot \nand condition, peace of heart, ennoblement of obedience, additional social happiness and sympathy, with something of \ntransfiguration and embelhshment, something of justification \nof all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all the semianimal poverty of their souls. Religion, together with the \nreligious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such per-, \npetually harassed men, and makes even their own aspect enjj \ndurable to them; it operates upon them as the EpicureaiC \nphilosophy usually operates upon sufferers of a higher order, \nin a refreshing and refining manner, almost tuming suffering \n\n\nto account, and in the end even halloing and vindicating it \nThere is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity an^ \nBuddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevat \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 69 \nthemselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things, \nand thereby to retain their satisfaction with the actual world \nin which they find it difficult enough to live — this very difficulty being necessary."

Among men, as among all \nother animals, there is a surplus of defective, diseased, degenerating, infirm, and necessarily suffering individuals; the \nsuccessful cases, among men also, are always the exception; \nand in view of the fact that man is the animal not yet properly adapted to his environment, the rare exception. But \nworse still. The higher the type a man represents, the \ngreater is the improbability that he will succeed; the accidental, the law of irrationahty in the general constitution of \nmcmkind, manifests itself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders of men, the conditions of whose \nlives are dehcate, diverse, and difficult to determine. What, \nthen, is the attitude of the two greatest religions above-mentioned to the surplus of failures in life? They endeavour to \npreserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact, \nas the religions for sufferers, they take the part of these upon \nprinciple; they are always in favour of those who suffer \nfrom life as from a disease, and they would fain treat every \nother experience of life as false and impossible. However \n■fcighly we may esteem this indulgent and preservative care \n70 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \n(inasmuch as in applying to others, it has apphed, and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type \nof man), the hitherto paramount religions — to give a general \nappreciation of them — are among the principal causes which \nhave kept the type of *'man\" upon a lower level — they have \npreserved too much that which should have perished. One \n\n\nhas to thank them for invaluable services; and who is sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation \nof all that the \"spiritual men\" of Christianity have done for \nEurope hitherto! But when they had given comfort to the \nsufferers, courage to the oppressed and despairing, a staff and \nsupport to the helpless, and when they had allured from society into convents and spiritual penitentiaries the brokenhearted and distracted: what else had they to do in order \nto work systematically in that fashion, and with a good conscience, for the preservation of all the sick and suffering, \nwhich means, in deed and in truth, to work for the deterioration of the European race? To reverse all estimates of \nvalue — that is what they had to do! And to shatter the \nstrong, to spoil great hopes, to cast suspicion on the delight \nin beauty, to break down everything autonomous, manly, \nconquering, and imperious — all instincts which are natural \nto the highest and most successful type of \"man\" — into uncertainty, distress of conscience, and self-destruction; forsooth, to invert all love of the earthly and of supremacy \nover the earth, into hatred of the earth and earthly things — \nthat is the task the Church imposed on itself, and was obhged \nto impose, until, according, to its standard of value, \"unworldhness,\" \"unsensuousness,\" and \"higher man\" fused into \ncMie sentiment.

Indeed, the expression, \"Science of Morals\" is, \nin respect to what is designated thereby, far too presumptuous and counter to good taste, — ^which is always a foretaste of more modest expressions. One ought to avow with \nthe utmost faimess what is still necessary here for a long \ntime, what is alone proper for the present: namely, the \ncollection of material, the comprehensive survey and classification of an immense domain of dehcate sentiments of \nworth, and distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, \nand perish — and perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of \nthe recurring and more common forms of these hving crystalhsations— as preparation for a theory of types of morality. \nTo be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest. All \nthe philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness, \ndemanded of themselves something very much higher, more \npretentious, and ceremonious, when they concemed themy4 \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 95 \nselves with morality as a science: they wanted to give a basis \nto morality — and every philosopher hitherto has believed \nthat he has given it a basis; morality itself, however, has \nbeen regarded as something \"given.\" How far from their \nawkward pride was the seemingly insignificant problem — \nleft in dust and decay — of a description of forms of morality, \nnotwithstanding that the finest hands and senses could hardly \nbe fine enough for it! It was precisely owing to moral philosophers knowing the moral facts imperfectly, in an arbitrary epitome, or an accidental abridgement — perhaps as \nthe morality of their environment, their position, their church, \ntheir Zeitgeist, their chmate and zone — it was precisely because they were badly instructed with regard to nations, \neras, and past ages, and were by no means eager to know \nabout these matters, that they did not even come in sight \nof the real problems of morals — problems which only disclose \nthemselves by a comparison of many kinds of morality. In \nevery \"Science of Morals\" hitherto, strange as it may sound, \nthe problem of morality itself has been omitted; there has \nbeen no suspicion that there was anything problematic there! \nThat which philosophers called \"giving a basis to morality,\" \nand endeavoured to reahse, has, when seen in a right light, \nproved merely a leamed form of good faith in prevaihng \nmorality, a new means of its expression, consequently just a \nmatter-of-fact within the sphere of a definite morality, yea, \nin its ultimate motive, a sort of denial that it is lawful for \nthis morality to be called in question — and in any case the \nreverse of the testing, analysing, doubting, and vivisecting \nof this very faith. Hear, for instance, with what innocence \n— almost worthy of honour — Schopenhauer represents his \nown task, and draw your conclusions conceming the scientificness of a \"Science\" whose latest master still talks in \nthe strain of children and old wives: \"The principle,\" he \n96 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nsays (page 136 of the Grundprobleme der Ethik*), \"the \naxiom about the purport of which all morahsts are practically \nagreed: neminem laede, immo omnes quantum potes juva — \nis really the proposition which all moral teachers strive to \nestablish, . . . the real basis of ethics which has been sought, \nhke the philosopher's stone, for centuries.\" — The difficulty of \nestablishing the proposition referred to may indeed be great \n\n\n— it is well known that Schopenhauer also was imsuccessful \nin his efforts; and whoever has thoroughly reahsed how \nabsurdly false and sentimental this proposition is, in a world \nwhose essence is Will to Power, may be reminded that \nSchopenhauer, although a pessimist, actually — played the \nflute . . . daily after dinner: one may read about the matter \nin his biography. A question by the way: a pessimist, a \nrepudiator of God and of the world, who makes a halt at \nmorality — who assents to morality, and plays the flute to \nlaede-neminem moraJs, what? Is that really — a pessimint?"

What is essential and \ninvaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a long \nconstraint. In order to understand Stoicism, or Port-Royal, \nor Puritanism, one should remember the constraint under \nwhich every language has attained to strength and freedom — \n\n\nthe metrical constraint, the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm. \nHow much trouble have the poets and orators of every nation \ngiven themselves! — not excepting some of the prose writers \nof to-day, in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousness— \"for the sake of a folly,\" as utihtarian bunglers say, \nand thereby deem themselves wise — \"from submission to \narbitrary laws,\" as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy \nthemselves \"free,\" even free-spirited. The singular fact remains, however, that everything of the nature of freedom, \nelegance, boldness, dance, and masterly certainty, which exists or has existed, whether it be in thought itself, or in \nadministration, or in speaking and persuading, in art just \nas in conduct, has only developed by means of the tyranny \nof such arbitrary law; and in all seriousness, it is not at all \nimprobable that precisely this is \"nature\" and \"natural\" — \n98 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nand not laisser-aller ! Every artist knows how different from \nthe state of letting himself go, is his \"most natural\" condition, \nthe free arranging, locating, disposing, and constructing in \nthe moments of \"inspiration\" — and how strictly and dehcately he then obeys a thousand laws, which, by their very \nrigidness and precision, defy all formulation by means of \nideas (even the most stable idea has, in comparison therewith, something floating, manifold, and ambiguous in it). \nThe essential thing \"in heaven and in earth\" is, apparently \n(to repeat it once more), that there should be long obedience \nin the same direction; there thereby results, and has always \nresulted in the long run, something which has made life \nworth hving; for instance, virtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spirituality — anything whatever that is transfiguring, \nrefined, foolish, or divine. The long bondage of the spirit, \nthe distrustful constraint in the communicabihty of ideas, \nthe disciphne which the thinker imposed on himself to think \nin accordance with the rules of a church or a court, or \nconformable to Aristotehan premises, the persistent spiritual \nwill to interpret everything that happened according to a \nChristian scheme, and in every occurrence to rediscover and \njustify the Christian God: — all this violence, arbitrariness, \nseverity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness, has proved itself the disciphnary means whereby the European spirit has \nattained its strength, its remorseless curiosity and subtle \nmobihty; granted also that much irrecoverable strength and \nspirit had to be stifled, suffocated, and spoilt in the process] \n(for here, as everywhere, \"nature\" shows herself as she is,l \nin all her extravagant and indifferent magnificence, which, \nis shocking, but nevertheless noble). That for centuries] \nEuropean thinkers only thought in order to prove somethingj \n\n\n— nowadays, on the contrary, we are suspicious of everyj \nthinker who \"wishes to prove something\" — that it was alwa) \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 99 \nsettled beforehand what was to be the result of their strictest \nthinking, as it was perhaps in the Asiatic astrology of former \ntimes, or as it is still at the present day in the innocent, \nChristian-moral explanation of immediate personal events \n\"for the glory of God,\" or \"for the good of the soul\":— this \ntyranny, this arbitrariness, this severe and magnificent stupidity, has educated the spirit; slavery, both in the coarser and \nthe finer sense, is apparently an indispensable means even \nof spiritual education and disciphne. One may look at every \nsystem of morals in this light: it is \"nature\" therein which \nteaches to hate the laisser-aller, the too great freedom, and \nimplants the need for limited horizons, for immediate duties \n— ^it teaches the narrowing of perspectives, and thus, in a \ncertain sense, that stupidity is a condition of life and development. \"Thou must obey some one, and for a long time; \notherwise thou wilt come to grief, and lose all respect for \nthyself\" — this seems to me to be the moral imperative of nature, which is certainly neither \"categorical,\" as old Kant \nwished (consequently the \"otherwise\"), nor does it address \nitself to the individual (what does nature care for the individual!), but to nations, races, ages, and ranks, above all, \nhowever, to the animal \"man\" generally, to mankind."

With \nhis repudiation of scepticism, it seems to them as if they \nheard some evil-threatening sound in the distance, as if a \nnew kind of explosive were being tried somewhere, a d)mamite of the spirit, perhaps a newly discovered Russian \nnihihne, a pessimism bonae voluntatis, that not only denies, \nmeans denial, but — dreadful thought! practises denial. \n128 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nAgainst this kind of \"good will\" — a will to the veritable, \nactual negation of life — there is, as is generally acknowledged \nnowadays, no better soporific and sedative than scepticism, \nthe mild, pleasing, lulhng poppy of scepticism; and Hamlet \nhimself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an \nantidote to the \"spirit,\" and its underground noises. \"Are \nnot our ears already full of bad sounds?\" say the sceptics, as \nlovers of repose, and almost as a kind of safety pohce, \"this \nsubterranean Nay is terrible! Be still, ye pessimistic moles! \" \nThe sceptic, in effect, that dehcate creature, is far too easily \nfrightened; his conscience is schooled so as to start at every \nNay, and even at that sharp, decided Yea, and feels something hke a bite thereby. Yea! and Nay! — they seem to \nhim opposed to morality; he loves, on the contrary, to make \na festival to his virtue by a noble aloofness, while perhaps \nhe says with Montaigne: \"What do I know?\" Or with \nSocrates: \"I know that I know nothing.\" Or: \"Here I do \nnot trust myself, no door is open to me.\" Or: \"Even if the \n\n\ndoor were open, why should I enter immediately?\" Or: \n\"What is the use of any hasty hypotheses? It might quite \nwell be in good taste to make no hypotheses at all. Are you \nabsolutely obhged to straighten at once what is crooked? to \nstuff every hole with some kind of oakum? Is there not \ntime enough for that? Has not the time leisure? Oh, ye \ndemons, can ye not at all wait? The uncertain also has \nits charms, the Sphinx, too, is a Circe, and Circe, too, was \na philosopher.\" — Thus does a sceptic console himself; and in \ntruth he needs some consolation. For scepticism is the most \nspiritual expression of a certain many-sided physiological \ntemperament, which in ordinary language is called nervous \ndebihty and sickhness; it arises whenever races or classes \nwhich have been long separated, decisively and suddenly \nblend with one another. In the new generation, which has \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 129 \ninherited as it were different standards and valuations in its \nblood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt, and tentative; the best powers operate restrictively, the very virtues \nprevent each other growing and becoming strong, equihbrium, \nballast, and perpendicular stabihty are lacking in body and \nsoul. That, however, which is most diseased and degenerated \nin such nondescripts is the will; they are no longer famihar \nwith independence of decision, or the courageous feehng of \npleasure in wilhng — they are doubtful of the \"freedom of the \nwill\" even in their dreams. Our present-day Europe, the \nscene of a senseless, precipitate attempt at a radical blending \nof classes, and consequently of races, is therefore sceptical \nin all its heights and depths, sometimes exhibiting the mobile \nscepticism which springs impatiently and wantonly from \nbranch to branch, sometimes with gloomy aspect, hke a \ncloud overcharged with interrogative signs — and often sick \nxmto death of its will! Paralysis of will; where do we not \nfind this cripple sitting nowadays! And yet how bedecked \noftentimes! How seductively omamented! There are the \nfinest gala dresses and disguises for this disease; and that, \nfor instance, most of what places itself nowadays in the \nshow-cases as \"objectiveness,\" \"the scientific spirit,\" \"I'art \npour I'art,\" and \"pure voluntary knowledge,\" is only deckedout scepticism and paralysis of will — I am ready to answer \nfor this diagnosis of the European disease.— The disease of \nthe will is diffused unequally over Europe; it is worst and \nmost varied where civihsation has longest prevailed; it \ndecreases according as \"the barbarian\" still — or again — asserts his claims under the loose drapery of Westem culture. \nIt is therefore in the France of to-day, as can be readily disclosed and comprehended, that the will is most infirm; and \n\n\nFrance, which has always had a masterly aptitude for con \nverting even the portentous crises of its spirit into something \n130 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \ncharming and seductive, now manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendency over Europe, by being the school and \nexhibition of all the charms of scepticism. The power to \nwill and to persist, moreover, in a resolution, is already \nsomewhat stronger in Germany, and again in the North of \nGermany it is stronger than in Central Germany; it is \nconsiderably stronger in England, Spain, and Corsica, associated with phlegm in the former and with hard skulls in the \nlatter — not to mention Italy, which is too young yet to \nknow what it wants, and must first show whether it can \nexercise will; but it is strongest and most surprising of all \nin that immense middle empire where Europe as it were flows \nback to Asia — namely, in Russia. There the power to will \nhas been long stored up and accumulated, there the will — \nuncertain whether to be negative or affirmative — waits threateningly to be discharged (to borrow their pet phrase from \nour physicists). Perhaps not only Indian wars and comphcations in Asia would be necessary to free Europe from its \ngreatest danger, but also intemal subversion, the shattering \nof the empire into small states, and above all the introduction \nof parhamentary imbecihty, together with the obhgation of \nevery one to read his newspaper at breakfast. I do not \nsay this as one who desires it; in my heart I should rather \nprefer the contrary — I mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of Russia, that Europe would have to make up \nits mind to become equally threatening — namely, to acquire \none will, by means of a new caste to rule over the Continent, \na persistent, dreadful will of its own, that can set its aims \nthousands of years ahead ; so that the long spun-out comedy \nof its petty-stateism, and its dynastic as well as its democratic many-willed-ness, might finally be brought to a close. \nThe time for petty pohtics is past; the next century \nbring the struggle for the dominion of the world — the cot \nPulsion to GTeat noh'tirs. \nwilL. \nomM, \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 131"

That \nunscrupulous enthusiast for big, handsome grenadiers (who, \nas King of Prussia, brought into being a mihtary and sceptical \ngenius — and therewith, in reality, the new and now triumphantly emerged type of German), the problematic, crazy \nfather of Frederick the Great, had on one point the very \nknack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew what was \nthen lacking in Germany, the want of which was a hundred \ntimes more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and \nsocial form — his ill-will to the young Frederick resulted from \nthe anxiety of a profound instinct. Men were lacking; and \nhe suspected, to his bitterest regret, that his own son was \nnot man enough. There, however, he deceived himself; \nbut who would not have deceived himself in his place? \nHe saw his son lapsed to atheism, to the esprit, to the pleasant \nfrivohty of clever Frenchmen — ^he saw in the background \nthe great bloodsucker, the spider scepticism; he suspected the \nincurable wretchedness of a heart no longer hard enough \neither for evil or good, and of a broken will that no longer \ncommands, is no longer able to command. Meanwhile, \nhowever, there grew up in his son that new kind of harder \nand more dangerous scepticism — who knows to what extent \nit was encouraged just by his father's hatred and the icy \nmelancholy of a will condemned to sohtude? — the scepticism \nof daring manhness, which is closely related to the genius \nfor war and conquest, and made its first entrance into Ger132 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nmany in the person of the great Frederick. This scepticism \ndespises and nevertheless grasps; it undermines and takes \npossession; it does not believe, but it does not thereby lose \nitself; it gives the spirit a dangerous liberty, but it keeps \nstrict guard over the heart. It is the German form of scepticism, which, as a continued Fredericianism, risen to the \nhighest spirituality, has kept Europe for a considerable time \nunder the dominion of the German spirit and its critical and \nhistorical distrust. Owing to the insuperably strong and \ntough masculine character of the great German philologists \nand historical critics (who, rightly estimated, were also all \nof them artists of destruction and dissolution), a new conception of the German spirit gradually established itself — in \nspite of all Romanticism in music and philosophy — in which \nthe leaning towards masculine scepticism was decidedly \n\n\nprominent: whether, for instance, as fearlessness of gaze, \nas courage and stemness of the dissecting hand, or as resolute \nwill to dangerous voyages of discovery, to spirituahsed \nNorth Pole expeditions under barren and dangerous skies. \nThere may be good groimds for it when warm-blooded and \nsuperficial humanitarians cross themselves before this spirit, \ncet esprit jatahste, ironique, mephistophehque, as Michelet \ncalls it, not without a shudder. But if one would reahse \nhow characteristic is this fear of the \"man\" in the German \nspirit which awakened Europe out of its \"dogmatic slumber,\" \nlet us call to mind the former conception which had to be \novercome by this new one — and that it is not so very long \nago that a mascuhnised woman could dare, with unbridled \npresumption, to recommend the Germans to the interest of \nEurope as gentle, good-hearted, weak-willed, and poetical \nfools. Finally, let us only understand profoundly enough \nNapoleon's astonishment when he saw Goethe: it reveals \nwhat had been regarded for centuries as the \"German spirit.\" \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 133 \n\"Voila un homme!\" — that was as much as to say: \"But this \nis a man!

It will seem \nto them no small indignity to philosophy to have it decreed, \nas is so welcome nowadays, that \"philosophy itself is criticism and critical science — and nothing else whatever!\" \nThough this estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval \nof all the Positivists of France and Germany (and possibly it \neven flattered the heart and taste of Kant: let us call to \nmind the titles of his principal works) , our new philosophers \nwill say, notwithstanding, that critics are instruments of the \nphilosopher, and just on that account, as instruments, they \nare far from being philosophers themselves!

Hitherto all \nthose extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one calls \nphilosophers — ^who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of \nwisdom, but rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators— ^have found their mission, their hard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end however the greatness \nof their mission), in being the bad conscience of their age. \nIn putting the vivisector's knife to the breast of the very \nvirtues of their age, they have betrayed their own secret; it \nhas been for the sake of a new greatness of man, a new imtrodden path to his aggrandisement. They have always disclosed how much hypocrisy, indolence, self-indulgence, and \nself-neglect, how much falsehood was concealed under the \nmost venerated types of contemporary morality, how much \nvirtue was outlived; they have always said: \"We must reBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 137 \nmove hence to where you are least at home.\" In face of a \nworld of \"modem ideas,\" which would hke to confine every \none in a comer, in a \"specialty,\" a philosopher, if there \ncould be philosophers nowadays, would be compelled to \nplace the greatness of man, the conception of \"greatness,\" \nprecisely in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness, in \nhis all-roundness; he would even determine worth and rank \naccording to the amount and variety of that which a man \ncould bear and take upon himself, according to the extent \nto which a man could stretch his responsibility.

(Is not a morahst the opposite of a Puritan? That is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as questionable, as worthy of interrogation, \nin short, as a problem? Is morahsing not — immoral?) In \nthe end, they all want English morality to be recognised as \n\n\nauthoritative, inasmuch as mankind, or the \"general utihty,\" \nor \"the happiness of the greatest number,'' — no! the happiness of England, will be best served thereby.

They \nwant more, they leam to make claims, the tribute of respect \nis at last felt to be well-nigh galhng; rivalry for rights, indeed actual strife itself, would be preferred: in a word, \nwoman is losing modesty. And let us immediately add that \n\n\nshe is also losing taste. She is unleaming to jear man: but \nthe woman who \"unleams to fear\" sacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should venture forward when \nthe fear-inspiring quality in man — or more definitely, thJi \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 167 \nman in man — is no longer either desired or fully developed, \nis reasonable enough and also intelhgible enough; what is \nmore difficult to understand is that precisely thereby — ■ \nwoman deteriorates. This is what is happening nowadays: \nlet us not deceive ourselves about it! Wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the mihtary and aristocratic \nspirit, woman strives for the economic and legal independence of a clerk: ''woman as clerkess\" is inscribed on the portal of the modem society which is in course of formation. \nWhile she thus appropriates new rights, aspires to be \"master,\" and inscribes \"progress\" of woman on her flags and \nbanners, the very opposite reahses itself with terrible obviousness: woman retrogrades. Since the French Revolution \nthe influence of woman in Europe has declined in proportion \nas she has increased her rights and claims; and the \"emancipation of woman,\" in so far as it is desired and demanded \nby women themselves (and not only by masculine shallowpates), thus proves to be a remarkable symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly instincts. There is stupidity in this movement, an almost masculine stupidity, of which a well-reared woman — who is always a sensible woman — might be heartily ashamed. To \nlose the intuition as to the ground upon which she can most \nsurely achieve victory; to neglect exercise in the use of her \nproper weapons; to let-herself-go before man, perhaps even \n\"to the book,\" where formerly she kept herself in control \nand in refined, artful humihty; to neutrahse with her virtuous audacity man's faith in a veiled, fundamentally differit ideal in woman, something etemally, necessarily femiine; to emphatically and loquaciously dissuade man from \nle idea that woman must be preserved, cared for, proected, and indulged, hke some dehcate, strangely wild, and \ntften pleasant domestic animal; the clumsy and indignant \n1 68 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \ncollection of everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of woman in the hitherto existing \norder of society has entailed and still entails (as though \nfslavery were a counter-argument, and not rather a condition \nof every higher culture, of every elevation of culture): — \n\n\nwhat does all this betoken, if not a disintegration of womanly \ninstincts, a de-feminising? Certainly, there are enough of \nidiotic friends and corrupters of woman amongst the leamed \nasses of the masculine sex, who advise woman to de-feminise \nherself in this manner, and to imitate all the stupidities from \nwhich \"man\" in Europe, European \"manhness,\" suffers, — \nwho would hke to lower woman to \"general culture,\" indeed \neven to newspaper reading and meddhng with pohtics. Here \nand there they wish even to make women into free spirits \nand hterary workers: as though a woman without piety \nwould not be something perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to \na profound and godless man; — almost everywhere her nerves \nare being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of \nmusic (our latest German music), and she is daily being \nmade more hysterical and more incapable of fulfilhng her \nfirst and last function, that of bearing robust children. They \nwish to \"cultivate\" her in general still more, and intend, as \nthey say, to make the \"weaker sex\" strong by culture: as \nif history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that \nthe \"cultivating\" of mankind and his weakening — that is to \nsay, the weakening, dissipating, and languishing of his force \nof will — have always kept pace with one another, and that \nthe most powerful and influential women in the world (and \nlastly, the mother of Napoleon) had just to thank their \nforce of will — and not their schoolmasters! — for their power \nand ascendency over men. That which inspires respect in \nwoman, and often enough fear also, is her nature, which is \nmore \"natural\" than that of man, her genuine, camivoraBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 169 \nhke, cunning flexibihty, her tiger-claws beneath the glove, \nher naivete in egoism, her untrainableness and innate wildness, the incomprehensibleness, extent and deviation of her \ndesires and virtues. . . . That which, in spite of fear, excites one's sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat, \n\"woman,\" is that she seems more affhcted, more vulnerable, \nmore necessitous of love and more condemned to disillusionment than any other creature. Fear and sympathy: it is \nwith these feehngs that man has hitherto stood in the presence of woman, always with one foot already in tragedy, \nwhich rends while it delights. — What? And all that is now \nto be at an end? And the disenchantment of woman is in \nprogress? The tediousness of woman is slowly evolving? \nOh Europe! Europe! We know the homed animal which \nwas always most attractive to thee, from which danger is \never again threatening thee!

It was mad \nperhaps to wish such a thing! But perhaps everything \ngreat has been just as mad at its commencement!\" — \"Misuse of words!\" cried his interlocutor, contradictorily — \n\"strong! strong! Strong and mad!

A \nGerman who would embolden himself to assert: \"Two souls, \nalas, dwell in my breast,\" would make a bad guess at the \ntruth, or, more correctly, he would come far short of the \ntruth about the number of souls. As a people made up of \nthe most extraordinary mixing and minghng of races, perhaps even with a preponderance of the pre-Aryan element, \nas the \"people of the centre\" in every sense of the term, \nthe Germans are more intangible, more ample, more conadictory, more unknown, more incalculable, more surI \n176 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nprising, and even more terrifying than other peoples are to \nthemselves: — they escape definition, and are thereby alone \nthe despair of the French. It is characteristic of the Germaas that the question: \"What is German?\" never dies \nout among them. Kotzebue certainly knew his Germans \nwell enough: \"we are known,\" they cried jubilantly to him — \nbut Sand also thought he knew them. Jean Paul knew \nwhat he was doing when he declared himself incensed at \nFichte's lying but patriotic flatteries and exaggerations, — \nbut it is probable that Goethe thought differently about Germans from Jean Paul, even though he acknowledged him to \nbe right with regard to Fichte. It is a question what Goethe \n\n\nreally thought about the Germans? — But about many things \naround him he never spoke explicitly, and all his life he \nknew how to keep an astute silence — probably he had good \nreason for it. It is certain that it was not the \"Wars of Independence\" that made him look up more joyfully, any \nmore than it was the French Revolution, — the event on \naccount of which he reconstructed his \"Faust,\" and indeed \nthe whole problem of \"man,\" was the appearance of Napoleon. There are words of Goethe in which he condemns \nwith impatient severity, as from a foreign land, that which \nGermans take a pride in: he once defined the famous German \ntum of mind as \"Indulgence towards its own and others' \nweaknesses.\" Was he wrong? it is characteristic of Germans \nthat one is seldom entirely wrong about them. The German \nsoul has passages and galleries in it, there are caves, hidingplaces, and dungeons thereir.; its disorder has much of the \ncharm of the mysterious; the German is well acquainted \nwith the by-paths to chaos. And as everything loves its \nsymbol, so the German loves the clouds and all that is obscure, evolving, crepuscular, damp, and shrouded: it seems \nto him that everything uncertain, undeveloped, self-displacBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 177 \ning, and growing is \"deep.\" The German himself does not \nexist: he is becoming, he is \"developing himself.\" \"Development\" is therefore the essentially German discovery and hit \nin the great domain of philosophical formulas, — a ruhng \nidea, which, together with German beer and German music, \nis labouring to Germanise all Europe. Foreigners are astonished and attracted by the riddles which the confhcting \nnature at the basis of the German soul propounds to them \n(riddles which Hegel systematised and Richard Wagner has \nin the end set to music). \"Good-natured and spiteful\" — \nsuch a juxtaposition, preposterous in the case of every other \npeople, is unfortunately only too often justified in Germany: \none has only to live for a while among Swabians to know \nthis! The clumsiness of the German scholar and his soci£il \ndistastefulness agree alarmingly well with his physical ropedancing and nimble boldness, of which all the Gods have \nleamt to be afraid. If any one wishes to see the \"German \nsoul\" demonstrated ad oculos, let him only look at German \ntaste, at German arts and manners: what boorish indifference \nto \"taste\"! How the noblest and the commonest stand \nthere in juxtaposition! How disorderly and how rich is the \nwhole constitution of this soul! The German drags at his \nsoul, he drags at everything he experiences. He digests his \nevents badly; he never gets \"done\" with them; and German \ndepth is often only a difficult, hesitating \"digestion.\" And \n\n\njust as all chronic invahds, all dyspeptics, hke what is convenient, so the German loves \"fr^ikness\" and \"honesty\"; \nit is so convenient to be frank and honest! — This confidingness, this complaisance, this showing-the-cards of German \nhonesty, is probably the most dangerous and most successful \ndisguise which the German is up to nowadays: it is his proper \nMephistophelean art; with this he can \"still achieve much\"! \nriBie German lets himself go, and thereby gazes with faithful, \n178 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nblue, empty German eyes — and other coimtries immediately \nconfound him with his dressing-gown! — I meant to say \nthat, let \"German depth\" be what it will — among ourselves \nalone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh at it — we shall do \nwell to continue henceforth to honour its appearance and \ngood name, and not barter away too cheaply our old reputation as a people of depth for Prussian \"smartness,\" and \nBerhn wit and sand. It is wise for a people to pose, and let \nitself be regarded, as profound, clumsy, good-natured, honest, \nand foolish: it might even be — profound to do so! Finally, \nwe should do honour to our name — we are not called the \n\"tiusche Volk\" (deceptive people) for nothing. . . ."

Ah, some time or other it will be over with it! — \nbut who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with the \nintelligence and taste for Beethoven! For he was only the \nlast echo of a break and transition in style, and not, hke \nMozart, the last echo of a great European taste which had \nexisted for centuries. Beethoven is the intermediate event \nbetween an old mellow soul that is constantly breaking down, \nand a future over-young soul that is always coming; there is \nspread over his music the twilight of etemal loss and etemal \nextravagant hope, — the same light in which Europe was \nbathed when it dreamed with Rousseau, when it danced \nround the Tree of Liberty of the Revolution, and finaOfll \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 179 \nalmost fell down in adoration before Napoleon.

Weber — ^but what do we care nowadays for \n\"Freischutz\" and \"Oberon\"! Or Marschner's \"Hans Helling\" and \"Vampyre\"! Or even Wagner's \"Tarmhauser\" ! \nThat is extinct, although not yet forgotten music. This whole \nmusic of Romanticism, besides, was not noble enough, was \nnot musical enough, to maintain its position anywhere but \nin the theatre and before the masses; from the beginning it \nwas second-rate music, which was httle thought of by genuine musicians. It was different with Fehx Mendelssohn, \nthat halcyon master, who, on account of his lighter, purer, \nhappier soul, quickly acquired admiration, and was equally \nquickly forgotten: as the beautiful episode of German music. \nBut with regard to Robert Schumann, who took things seriously, and has been taken seriously from the first— he \nwas the last that founded a school, — do we not now regard \nit as a satisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this very \nRomanticism of Schumann's has been surmounted? Schumann, fleeing into the \"Saxon Switzerland\" of his soul, with \na half Werther-hke, half Jean-Paul-hke nature (assuredly \nnot hke Beethoven! assuredly not hke Byron!) — ^his Manfred music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent \nof injustice; Schumann, with his taste, which was fundai8o BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nmaitally a petty taste (that is to say, a dangerous propensity \n— doubly dangerous among Germans — for quiet lyricism and \nintoxication of the feehngs), going constantly apart, timidly \nwithdrawing and retiring, a noble weakhng who revelled in \nnothing but zmonymous joy and sorrow, from the begirming \na sort of girl and noh me tangere — this Schumann was already merely a German event in music, and no longer a \nEuropean event, as Beethoven had been, as in a still greater \ndegree Mozart had been ; with Schumann German music was \nthreatened with its greatest danger, that of losing the voice \nfor the soul of Europe and sinking into a merely national \naffair."

In a loud voice: that is to say, with all \nthe swelhngs, inflections, and variations of key and changes \nof tempo, in which the ancient pubhc world took delight. \n\n\nThe laws of the written style were then the same as those \nof the spoken style; and these laws depended partly on the \nsurprising development and refined requirements of the ear \nand larynx; partly on the strength, endurance, and power \nof the ancient lungs.

About the Jews, for instance, hsten \nto the following: — I have never yet met a German who was \nfavourably inclined to the Jews; and however decided the \nrepudiation of actual anti-Semitism may be on the part of \nall prudent and pohtical men, this prudence and pohcy is not \nperhaps directed against the nature of the sentiment itself, \nbut only against its dangerous excess, and especially against \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 185 \nthe distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of \nsentiment; — on this point we must not deceive ourselves. \nThat Germany has amply sufficient Jews, that the German \nstomach, the German blood, has difficulty (and will long \nhave difficulty) in disposing only of this quantity of \"Jew\" \n— as the Itahan, the Frenchman, and the Englishman have \ndone by means of a stronger digestion: — that is the immistakable declaration and language of a general instinct, \nto which one must hsten and according to which one must \nact. \"Let no more Jews come in! And shut the doors, \nespecially towards the East (also towards Austria) ! \" — thus \ncommands the instinct of a people whose nature is still \nfeeble and uncertain, so that ii could be easily wiped out, \neasily extinguished, by a stronger race. The Jews, however, \nare beyond all doubt the strongest, toughest, and purest race \nat present hving in Europe; they know how to succeed even \nunder the worst conditions (in fact better than under favourable ones), by means of virtues of some sort, which one \nwould hke nowadays to label as vices — owing above all to a \nresolute faith which does not need to be ashamed before \n\"modem ideas\"; they alter only, wken they do alter, in the \nsame way that the Russian Empire makes its conquest — as \nan empire that has plenty of time and is not of yesterday — \nnamely, according to the principle, \"as slowly as possible\"! \nA thinker who has the future of Europe at heart, ^vill, in all \nhis perspectives conceming the future, calculate upon the \nJews, as he will calculate upon the Russians, as above all \nthe surest and hkehest factors in the great play and battle \nof forces. That which is at present called a \"nation\" in \nEurope, and is really rather a res facta than nata (indeed, \nsometimes confusingly similar to a res ficta et picta), is in \n\n\nevery case something evolving, young, easily displaced, and \nnot yet a race, much less such a race acre perennius, as the \n1 85 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nJews are: such \"nations\" should most carefully avoid all hotheaded rivalry and hostihty! It is certain that the Jews, \nif they desired — or if they were driven to it, as the antiSemites seem to wish — could now have the ascendency, nay, \nhterally the supremacy, over Europe; that they are not working and planning for that end is equally certain. Meanwhile, \nthey rather wish and desire, even somewhat importunely, to \nbe insorbed and absorbed by Europe; they long to be finally \nsettled, authorised, and respected somewhere, and wish to \nput an end to the nomadic life, to the \"wandering Jew\"; — \nand one should certainly take account of this impulse and \ntendency, and make advances to it (it possibly betokens a \nmitigation of the Jewish instincts) : for which purpose it \nwould perhaps be useful and fair to banish the anti-Semitic \nbawlers out of the country. One should make advances \nwith all prudence, and with selection; pretty much as the \nEnglish nobility do. It stands to reason that the more powerful and strongly marked types of new Germanism could \nenter into relation with the Jews with the least hesitation, \nfor instance, the nobleman officer from the Prussian border: \nit would be interesting in many ways to see whether the \ngenius for money and patience (and especially some intellect \nand intellectuahty — sadly lacking in the place referred to) \ncould not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of commanding and obeying — for both of which the \ncountry in question has now a classic reputation. But here \nit is expedient to break off my festal discourse and my \nsprightly Teutonomania: for I have already reached my \nserious topic, the \"European problem,\" as I understand it, \nthe rearing of a new ruhng caste for Europe. \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 187"

It \nwas against Hume that Kant uprose and raised himself; \nit was Locke of whom Schelhng rightly said, \"Je meprise \nLocke\" ; in the struggle against the English mechanical stultification of the world, Hegel and Schopenhauer (along with \nGoethe) were of one accord; the two hostile brother-geniuses \nin philosophy, who pushed in different directions towards the \nopposite poles of German thought, and thereby wronged each \nother as only brothers will do. — What is lacking in England, \nand has always been lacking, that half-actor and rhetorician \nknew well enough, the absurd muddle-head, Carlyle, who \nsought to conceal under passionate grimaces what he knew \nabout himself: namely, what was lacking in Carlyle — real \npower of intellect, real depth of intellectual perception, in \nshort, philosophy. It is characteristic of such an unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to Christianity — they need \nits disciphne for \"morahsing\" and humanising.

To finer nostrils, this English Christianity itself \nhas still a characteristic English taint of spleen and alcohohc \nexcess, for which, owing to good reasons, it is used as an \nantidote — the finer poison to neutrahse the coarser: a finer \nform of poisoning is in fact a step in advance with coarsemannered people, a step towards spirituahsation.

That, however, which \noffends even in the humanest Englishman is his lack of music, \nto speak figuratively (and also hterally): he has neither \nrhythm nor dance in the movements of his soul and body; \nindeed, not even the desire for rhythm and dance, for \n\"music.\" Listen to him speaking; look at the most beautiful \nEnglishwoman walking — in no country on earth are there \nmore beautiful doves and swans; finally, hsten to them singing! But I ask too much. . . . \nThere are truths which are best recognised by mediocre \nminds, because they are best adapted for them, there are \ntruths which only possess charms and seductive power for \nmediocre spirits: — one is pushed to this probably unpleasant \nconclusion, now that the influence of respectable but mediocre Englishmen — I may mention Darwin, John Stuart Mill, \n\n\nand Herbert Spencer — begins to gain the ascendency in the \nmiddle-class region of European taste. Indeed, who could \ndoubt that it is a useful thing for such minds to have the \nascendency for a time? It would be an error to consider \nthe highly developed and independently soaring minds as \nspecially quahfied for determining and collecting many httle \ncommon facts, and deducing conclusions from them; as exceptioiis, they are rather from the first in no very favourable \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL i&> \nposition towards those who are \"the rules.\" After all, they \nhave more to do than merely to perceive: — in effect, they \nhave to be something new, they have to signify something \nnew, they have to represent new values!

What is called \"modem ideas,\" or \"the ideas of \nthe eighteenth century,\" or \"French ideas\" — that, consequently, against which the German mind rose up with \nprofovmd disgust — is of English origin, there is no doubt \nabout it.

They have all something in \ncommon: they keep their ears closed in presence of the \ndehrious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic bourgeois. In fact, a besotted and brutahsed France at present \nsprawls in the foreground — it recently celebrated a veritable \norgy of bad taste, and at the same time of self-admiration, \nat the funeral of Victor Hugo. There is also something else \ncommon to them: a predilection to resist intellectual Germanising— and a still greater inabihty to do so! In this \nFrance of intellect, which is also a France of pessimism, \nSchopenhauer has perhaps become more at home, and more \nindigenous than he has ever been in Germany; not to speak \nof Heinrich Heine, who has long ago been re-incamated in \nthe more refined and fastidious lyrists of Paris; or of Hegel, \nwho at present, in the form of Taine — the first of hving historians— exercises an almost tyrannical influence. As regards Richard Wagner, however, the more French music \nleams to adapt itself to the actual needs of the dme modeme, \nthe more will it \"Wagnerise\"; one can safely predict that \nbeforehand, — it is already taking place sufficiently! There \nare, however, three things which the French can still boast \nof with pride as their heritage and possession, and as indehble \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 191 \ntokens of their ancient intellectual superiority in Europe, in \nspite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanising and vul-, \ngarising of taste. Firstly, the capacity for artistic emotion, \nfor devotion to \"form,\" for which the expression, Vart pour \nI' art, along with numerous others, has been invented: — such \ncapacity has not been lacking in France for three centuries; \nand owing to its reverence for the \"small number,\" it has \nagain and again made a sort of chamber music of hterature \npossible, which is sought for in vain elsewhere in Europe. — \nThe second thing whereby the French c£in lay claim to a \nsuperiority over Europe is their ancient, many-sided, moralistic culture, owing to which one finds on an average, even \nin the petty romanciers of the newspapers and chance boulevardiers de Paris, a psychological sensitiveness and curiosity, \nof which, for example, one has no conception (to say nothing of the thing itself ! ) in Germany. The Germans lack a \n\n\ncouple of centuries of the morahstic work requisite thereto, \nwhich, as we have said, France has not grudged: those who \ncall the Germans \"naive\" on that account give them com^ \nmendation for a defect. (As the opposite of the German \ninexperience and innocence in voluptate psychologica, which \nis not too remotely associated with the tediousness of German intercourse, — and as the most successful expression of \ngenuine French curiosity and inventive talent in this domain \nof dehcate thrills, Henri Beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory and forerunning man, who, with a Napoleonic tempo, traversed his Europe, in fact, several \ncenturies of the European soul, as a surveyor and discoverer \nthereof: — it has required two generations to overtake him \none way or other, to divine long afterwards some of the \nriddles that perplexed and enraptured him — this strange \nEpicurean and man of interrogation, the last great psychologist of France). — There is yet a third claim to superiority: \n192 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \n'\"n the French character there is a successful half-way s)^!thesis of the North and South, which makes them comprehend many things, and enjoins upon them other things, \nwhich an Englishman can never comprehend. Their temperament, tumed altemately to and from the South, in \nwhich from time to time the Provencal and Ligurian blood \nfroths over, preserves them from the dreadful, northem \ngray-in-gray, from sunless conceptual-spectrism and from \npoverty of blood — our German infirmity of taste, for the \nexcessive prevalence of which at the present moment, blood \nand iron, that is to say \"high pohtics,\" has with great resolution been prescribed (according to a dangerous heahng art, \nwhich bids me wait and wait, but not yet hope). — There is \nalso still in France a pre-understanding and ready welcome \nfor those rarer and rarely gratified men, who are too comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism, \nand know how to love the South when in the North £md the \nNorth when in the South — the bom Midlanders, the \"good \nEuropeans.\" For them Bizet has made music, this latest \ngenius, who has seen a new beauty and seduction, — who has \ndiscovered a piece of the South in music."

The distinctions of moral values have either \noriginated in a ruhng caste, pleasantly conscious of being \ndifferent from the ruled — or among the ruled class, the slaves \nand dependents of all sorts. In the first case, when it is the \nrulers who determine the conception \"good,\" it is the exalted, proud disposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that which determines the order of rank. \nThe noble type of man separates from himself the beings in \nwhom the opposite of this exalted, proud disposition displays \nitself: he despises them. Let it at once be noted that in \nthis first kind of morality the antithesis \"good\" and \"bad\" \nmeans practically the same as \"noble\" and \"despicable\"; — \nthe antithesis \"good\" and \"evil\" is of a different origin. The \ncowardly, the timid, the insignificant, and those thinking \nmerely of narrow utihty are despised; moreover, also, the \ndistrustful, with their constrained glances, the self-abasing, \nthe dog-hke kind of men who let themselves be abused, the \nmendicant flatterers, and above all the hars: — it is a fimdamental belief of all aristocrats that the common people are \nuntruthful. \"We truthful ones\" — the nobility in ancient \nGreece called themselves. It is obvious that everywhere the \ndesignations of moral value were at first apphed to men, \nand were only derivatively and at a later period apphed to \nactions; it is a gross mistake, therefore, when historians \nof morals start with questions hke, \"Why have sympathetic \nactions been praised?\" The noble type of man regards \nhimself as a determiner of values; he does not require to be \napproved of; he passes the judgment: \"What is injurious to \nme is injurious in itself\"; he knows that it is he himself only \nwho confers honour on things; he is a creator of values. \nHe honours whatever he recognises in himself: such morality \n202 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \n\n\nis self-glorification. In the foreground there is the feehng \nof plenitude, of power, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the consciousness of a wealth which \nwould fain give and bestow: — the noble man also helps the \nunfortunate, but not — or scarcely — out of pity, but rather \nfrom an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power. \nThe noble man honours in himself the powerful one, him also \nwho has power over himself, who knows how to speak and \nhow to keep silence, who takes pleasure in subjecting himself \nto severity and hardness, and has reverence for all that is \nsevere and hard. \"Wotan placed a hard heart in my breast,\" \nsays an old Scandinavian Saga: it is thus rightly expressed \nfrom the soul of a proud Viking. Such a type of man is \neven proud of not being made for sympathy; the hero of \nthe Saga therefore adds wamingly: \"He who has not a \nhard heart when young, will never have one.\" The noble and \nbrave who think thus are the furthest removed from the \nmorality which sees precisely in sympathy, or in acting for \nthe good of others, or in disinter essement, the characteristic \nof the moral; faith in oneself, pride in oneself, a radical enmity and irony towards \"selflessness,\" belong as definitely to \nnoble morality, as do a careless scom and precaution in \npresence of sympathy and the \"warm heart.\" — It is the powerful who know how to honour, it is their art, their domain \nfor invention. The profound reverence for age and for \ntradition — all law rests on this double reverence, — the belief \nand prejudice in favour of ancestors and unfavourable to \nnewcomers, is typical in the morality of the powerful ; and if, \nreversely, men of \"modem ideas\" believe almost instinctively \nin \"progress\" and the \"future,\" and are more and more lacking in respect for old age, the ignoble origin of these \"ideas\"j \nhas complacently betrayed itself thereby. A morality of thj \nruhng class, however, is more especially foreign and irritating \nBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL 203 \nto present-day taste in the stemness of its principle that one \nhas duties only to one's equals; that one may act towards \nbeings of a lower rank, towards all that is foreign, just as \nseems good to one, or \"as the heart desires,\" and in any case \n\"beyond good and evil\": it is here that sympathy and similar \nsentiments can have a place. The abihty and obhgation \nto exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge — both \nonly within the circle of equals, — artfulness in retahation, \nraffinement of the idea in friendship, a certain necessity to \nhave enemies (as outlets for the emotions of envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogance — in fact, in order to be a good friend) : \nall these are t5rpical characteristics of the noble morality, \nwhich, as has been pointed out, is not the morality of \"modem ideas,\" and is therefore at present difficult to reahse, \nand also to unearth and disclose. — It is otherwise with the \nsecond type of morality, slave-morality. Supposing that the \nabused, the oppressed, the suffering, the unemancipated, the \nweary, and those uncertain of themselves, should morahse, \nwhat will be the common element in their moral estimates? \nProbably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire \nsituation of man will find expression, perhaps a condemnation \nof man, together with his situation. The slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the powerful ; he has a scepticism and distrust, a refinement of distrust of everything \n\"good\" that is there honoured — he would fain persuade himself that the very happiness there is not genuine. On the \nother hand, those quahties which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are brought into prominence and flooded \nwith light; it is here that sympathy, the kind, helping hand, \nthe warm heart, patience, dihgence, humihty, and friendhness \nattain to honour; for here these are the most useful quahties, \nand almost the only means of supporting the burden of \nexistence. Slave-morality is essentially the morality of utihty. \n204 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \nHere is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis \"good\" \nand \"evil\": — power and dangerousness are assumed to reside \nin the evil, a certain dreadfulness, subtlety, and strength, \nwhich do not admit of being despised. According to slavemorality, therefore, the \"evil\" man arouses fear; according \nto master-morality, it is precisely the \"good\" man who arouses \nfear and seeks to arouse it, while the bad man is regarded \nas the despicable being. The contrast attains its maximum \nwhen, in accordance with the logical consequences of slavemorality, a shade of depreciation — it may be slight and wellintentioned — at last attaches itself to the \"good\" man of \nthis morality; because, according to the servile mode of \nthought, the good man must in any case be the safe man: he \nis good-natured, easily deceived, perhaps a httle stupid, un \nbonkomme. Everjrwhere that slave-morality gains the ascendency, language shows a tendency to approximate the \nsignifications of the words \"good\" and \"stupid.\" — A last \nfundamental difference: the desire for freedom, the instinct \nfor happiness and the refinements of the feehng of liberty \nbelong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as artifice \nand enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular \nsymptoms of an aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating. \n■ — Hence we can understand without further detail why love \nas a passion — it is our European specialty — must absolutely \nbe of noble origin; as is well known, its invention is due to \nthe Provengal poet-cavahers, those brilhant, ingenious men \n\n\nof the \"gai saber,\" to whom Europe owes so much, and \nalmost owes itself."

This seems to him on the one hand such bad taste \nand so self -disrespectful, and on the other hand so grotesquely \nunreasonable, that he would hke to consider vanity an exception, and is doubtful about it in most cases when it is \nspoken of. He will say, for instance: \"I may be mistaken \nabout my value, and on the other hand may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others precisely as I rate it: — that, however, is not vanity (but selfconceit, or, in most cases, that which is called 'humihty,' \nand also 'modesty').\" Or he will even say: \"For many reasons I can delight in the good opinion of others, perhaps \nbecause I love and honour them, and rejoice in all their \njoys, perhaps also because their good opinion endorses zmd \nstrengthens my belief in my own good opinion, perhaps \nbecause the good opinion of others, even in cases where I do \nnot share it, is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness: — \nall this, however, is not vemity.\" The man of noble character \nmust first bring it home forcibly to his mind, especially with \nthe aid of history, that, from time immemorial, in all social \nstrata in any way dependent, the ordinary man was only \nthat which he passed for: — ^not being at all accustomed to \nfix values, he did not assign even to himself any other value \nthan that which his master assigned to him (it is the pecuhar \nright of masters to create values). It may be looked upon \nas the result of an extraordinary atavism, that the ordinary \nman, even at present, is still always waiting for an opinion \nabout himself, and then instinctively submitting himself to \nit; yet by no means only to a \"good\" opinion, but also to \n2o6 BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL \n\n\na bad and unjust one (think, for instance, of the greater \npart of the self-appreciations and self-depreciations which \nbeheving women leam from their confessors, and which in \ngeneral the beheving Christian leams from his Church). \nIn fact, conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social \norder (and its cause, the blending of the blood of masters \nand slaves), the originally noble and rare impulse of the \nmasters to assign a value to themselves and to \"think well\" \nof themselves, will now be more and more encouraged and \nextended; but it has at all times an older, ampler, and more \nradically ingrained propensity opposed to it — and in the \nphenomenon of \"vanity\" this older propensity overmasters \nthe younger. The vain person rejoices over every good opinion which he hears about himself (quite apart from the point \nof view of its usefulness, and equally regardless of its truth \nor falsehood), just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for \nhe subjects himself to both, he ]eeh himself subjected to \nboth, by that oldest instinct of subjection which breaks \nforth in him. — It is \"the slave\" in the vain man's blood, the \nremains of the slave's craftiness — and how much of the \n\"slave\" is still left in woman, for instance! — which seeks to \nseduce to good opinions of itself; it is the slave, too, who \nimmediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these \nopinions, as though he had not called them forth. — And to \nrepeat it agziin: vanity is an atavism."
