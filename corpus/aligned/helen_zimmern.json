Not  to  assume  several  kinds  of \ncausality,  so  long  as  the  attempt  to  get  along  with  a  single \none  has  not  been  pushed  to  its  furtherest  extent  (to  absurd- \nity, if  I  may  be  allowed  to  say  so) :  that  is  a  morality  of \nmethod  which  one  may  not  repudiate  nowadays — it  follows \n\"from  its  definition,\"  as  mathematicians  say.  The  question \nis  ultimately  whether  we  really  recognise  the  will  as  operat- \ning, whether  we  believe  in  the  causality  of  the  will ;  if  we  do \nso — and  fundamentally  our  belief  in  this  is  just  our  belief  in \ncausality  itself — we  must  make  the  attempt  to  posit  hypo- \nthetically  the  causality  of  the  will  as  the  only  causality. \n\"Will\"  can  naturally  only  operate  on  \"will\" — and  not  on \n\"matter\"  (not  on  \"nerves,\"  for  instance) :  in  short,  the \nhypothesis  must  be  hazarded,  whether  will  does  not  operate \non  will  wherever  \"effects\"  are  recognised — and  whether  all \nmechanical  action,  inasmuch  as  a  power  operates  therein,  is \nnot  just  the  power  of  will,  the  effect  of  will.  Granted, \nfinally,  that  we  succeeded  in  explaining  our  entire  instinc- \ntive life  as  the  development  and  ramification  of  one  funda- \nmental form  of  will — namely,  the  Will  to  Power,  as  my \nthesis  puts  it;  granted  that  all  organic  functions  could  be \ntraced  back  to  this  Will  to  Power,  and  that  the  solution \nof  the  problem  of  generation  and  nutrition — it  is  one  prob- \nlem— could  also  be  found  therein:  one  would  thus  have  ac- \nquired the  right  to  define  all  active  force  unequivocally  as \nWiU  to  Power.  The  world  seen  from  within,  the  world  de- \nfined and  designated  according  to  its  \"intelligible  character\" \n— it  would  simply  be  \"Will  to  Power,\"  and  nothing  else. \n\n\n44  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL"

There  is  distrust  of  these  modem \nideas  in  this  mode  of  looking  at  things,  a  disbelief  in  all  that \nhas  been  constructed  yesterday  and  to-day;  there  is  per- \nhaps some  slight  admixture  of  satiety  and  scom,  which  can \nno  longer  endure  the  bric-a-brac  of  ideas  of  the  most  varied \norigin,  such  as  so-called  Positivism  at  present  throws  on  the \nmarket;  a  disgust  of  the  more  refined  taste  at  the  village-fair \nmotleyness  and  patchiness  of  all  these  reality-philosophasters, \nin  whom  there  is  nothing  either  new  or  true,  except  this \nmotlejTiess.

A  little  more  strength,  swing,  courage,  and \nartistic  power,  and  they  would  be  o§ — and  not  back! \nBEYOND   GOOD  AND   EVIL  ii \nI \nIX \nIt  seems  to  me  that  there  is  everywhere  an  attempt  at \npresent  to  divert  attention  from  the  actual  influence  which \nKant  exercised  on  German  philosophy,  and  especially  to  ig- \nnore prudently  the  value  which  he  set  upon  himself.  Kant \n\n\nwas  first  and  foremost  proud  of  his  Table  of  Categories; \nwith  it  in  his  hand  he  said:  \"This  is  the  most  difficult  thing \nthat  could  ever  be  undertaken  on  behalf  of  metaphysics.\" \nLet  us  only  understand  this  \"could  be\"!  He  was  proud  of \nhaving  discovered  a  new  faculty  in  man,  the  faculty  of \nsynthetic  judgment  a  priori.  Granting  that  he  deceived  him- \nself in  this  matter;  the  development  and  rapid  flourishing \nof  German  philosophy  depended  nevertheless  on  his  pride, \nand  on  the  eager  rivalry  of  the  younger  generation  to  dis- \ncover if  possible  something — at  all  events  \"new  faculties\" — \nof  which  to  be  still  prouder! — But  let  us  reflect  for  a \nmoment — it  is  high  time  to  do  so.  \"How  are  synthetic  judg- \nments a  priori  possible?\"  Kant  asks  himself — and  what  is \nreally  his  answer?  \"By  means  of  a  means  (faculty)\" — ^but \nunfortunately  not  in  five  words,  but  so  circumstantially,  im- \nposingly, and  with  such  display  of  German  profimdity  and \nverbal  flourishes,  that  one  altogether  loses  sight  of  the \ncomical  niaiserie  allemande  involved  in  such  an  answer.  Peo- \nple were  beside  themselves  with  delight  over  this  new  fac- \n^  ulty,  and  the  jubilation  reached  its  climeix  v/hen  Kant  further \ndiscovered  a  moral  faculty  in  man — for  at  that  time  Germans \nwere  still  moral,  not  yet  dabbling  in  the  \"Politics  of  hard \nfact.\"  Then  came  the  honeymoon  of  German  philosophy. \nAll  the  young  theologians  of  the  Tiibingen  institution  went \nI  mmediately  into  the  groves — all  seeking  for  \"faculties.\" \njri  .tod  what  did  they  not  find — in  that  innocent,  rich,  and  still \nII \n12  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nyouthful  period  of  the  German  spirit,  to  which  Romanticism, \nthe  malicious  fairy,  piped  and  sang,  when  one  could  not  yet \ndistinguish  between  \"finding\"  and  \"inventing\"!  Above  all \na  faculty  for  the  \"transcendental\";  Schelling  christened  it, \nintellectual  intuition,  and  thereby  gratified  the  most  earnest \nlongings  of  the  naturally  pious-inclined  Germans.  One  can \ndo  no  greater  wrong  to  the  whole  of  this  exuberant  and  ec- \ncentric movement  (which  was  really  youthfulness,  notwith- \nstanding that  it  disguised  itself  so  boldly  in  hoary  and  senile \nconceptions),  than  to  take  it  seriously,  or  even  treat  it  with \nmoral  indignation.  Enough,  however — the  world  grew  older, \nand  the  dream  vanished.  A  time  came  when  people  rubbed \ntheir  foreheads,  and  they  still  rub  them  to-day.  People  had \nbeen  dreaming,  and  first  and  foremost — old  Kant.  \"By \nmeans  of  a  means  (faculty)\" — he  had  said,  or  at  least  meant \nto  say.  But,  is  that — an  answer?  An  explanation?  Or \n\n\nis  it  not  rather  merely  a  repetition  of  the  question?  How \ndoes  opium  induce  sleep?  \"By  means  of  a  means  (faculty),\" \nnamely  the  virtus  dormitiva,  replies  the  doctor  in  Moliere, \nQuia  est  in  eo  virtus  dormitiva, \nCujus  est  natura  sensus  assoupire. \nBut  such  replies  belong  to  the  realm  of  comedy,  and  it  is \nhigh  time  to  replace  the  Kantian  question,  \"How  are  syn- \nthetic judgments  a  priori  possible?\"  by  another  question, \n\"Why  is  belief  in  such  judgments  necessary?\" — in  effect,  it \nhigh  time  that  we  should  imderstand  that  such  judgments, \nmust  be  believed  to  be  true,  for  the  sake  of  the  preserva- \ntion of  creatures  like  ourselves;  though  they  still  might] \nnaturally  be  false  judgments!  Or,  more  plainly  spokeUjj \nand  roughly  and  readily — synthetic  judgments  a  priori  shoulc \nnot  \"be  possible\"  at  all;  we  have  no  right  to  them;  in  oui \nBEYOND   GOOD  AND  EVIL  13 \nmouths  they  are  nothing  but  false  judgments).  Only,  of \ncourse,  the  belief  in  their  truth  is  necessary,  as  plausible \nbelief  and  ocular  evidence  belonging  to  the  perspective  view \nof  life.  And  finally,  to  call  to  mind  the  enormous  influence \nwhich  \"German  philosophy\" — I  hope  you  understand  its \nright  to  inverted  commas  (gooseteet)? — has  exercised \nthroughout  the  whole  of  Europe,  there  is  no  doubt  that  a \ncertain  virtus  dormitiva  had  a  share  in  it;  thanks  to  German \nphilosophy,  it  was  a  delight  to  the  noble  idlers,  the  virtuous, \nthe  mystics,  the  artists,  the  three- fourths  Christians,  and  the \npolitical  obscurantists  of  all  nations,  to  find  an  antidote  to \nthe  still  overwhelming  sensualism  which  overflowed  from \nthe  last  century  into  this,  in  short — \"sensus  assoupire.\"  .  .  . \ny2 \nAs  regards  materialistic  atomism,  it  is  one  of  the  best \nrefuted  theories  that  have  been  advanced,  and  in  Europe \nthere  is  now  perhaps  no  one  in  the  learned  world  so  un- \nscholarly  as  to  attach  serious  signification  to  it,  except  for \nconvenient  everyday  use  (as  an  abbreviation  of  the  means \nof  expression) — thanks  chiefly  to  the  Pole  Boscovich:  he \nand  the  Pole  Copernicus  have  hitherto  been  the  greatest  and \nmost  successful  opponents  of  ocular  evidence.  For  whilst \nCopernicus  has  persuaded  us  to  believe,  contrary  to  all  the \nsenses,  that  the  earth  does  not  stand  fast,  Boscovich  has \ntaught  us  to  abjure  the  belief  in  the  last  thing  that  \"stood \n\n\nfast\"  of  the  earth — the  belief  in  \"substance,\"  in  \"matter,\" \nin  the  earth-residuum,  and  particle-atom:  it  is  the  greatest \ntriumph  over  the  senses  that  has  hitherto  been  gained  on \nearth.  One  must,  however,  go  still  further,  and  also  declare \nwar,  relentless  war  to  the  knife,  against  the  \"atomistic  re- \nquirements\" which  still  lead  a  dangerous  after-life  in  places \n14  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nwhere  no  one  suspects  them,  like  the  more  celebrated  \"meta- \nphysical requirements\":  one  must  also  above  all  give  the  fin- \nishing stroke  to  that  other  and  more  portentous  atomism \nwhich  Christianity  has  taught  best  and  longest,  the  soul- \natomism.  Let  it  be  permitted  to  designate  by  this  expression \nthe  belief  which  regards  the  soul  as  something  indestructible, \neternal,  indivisible,  as  a  monad,  as  an  atomon:  this  belief \nought  to  be  expelled  from  science!  Between  ourselves,  it  is \nnot  at  all  necessary  to  get  rid  of  \"the  soul\"  thereby,  and  thus \nrenounce  one  of  tlie  oldest  and  most  venerated  hj^otheses — \nas  happens  frequently  to  the  clumsiness  of  naturalists,  who \ncan  hardly  touch  on  the  soul  without  immediately  losing  it. \nBut  the  way  is  open  for  new  acceptations  and  refinements  of \nthe  soul-hypothesis;  and  such  conceptions  as  \"mortal  soul,\" \nand  \"soul  of  subjective  multiplicity,\"  and  \"soul  as  social \nstructure  of  the  instincts  and  passions,\"  want  henceforth  to \nhave  legitimate  rights  in  science.  In  that  the  new  psycholo- \ngist is  about  to  put  an  end  to  the  superstitions  which  have \nhitherto  flourished  with  almost  tropical  luxuriance  around  the \nidea  of  the  soul,  he  is  really,  as  it  were,  thrusting  himself  into \na  new  desert  and  a  new  distrust — it  is  possible  that  the  older \npsychologists  had  a  merrier  and  more  comfortable  time  of \nit;  eventually,  however,  he  finds  that  precisely  thereby  he \nis  also  condemned  to  invent — and,  who  knows?  perhaps  to \ndiscover  the  new."

Only  that  which  can  be  seen  and  felt — one \nmust  pursue  every  problem  thus  far.  Obversely,  however, \nthe  charm  of  the  Platonic  mode  of  thought,  which  was  an \naristocratic  mode,  consisted  precisely  in  resistance  to  obvious \nsense-evidence — perhaps  among  men  who  enjoyed  even \nstronger  and  more  fastidious  senses  than  our  contemporaries, \nbut  who  knew  how  to  find  a  higher  triumph  in  remaining \nmasters  of  them:  and  this  by  means  of  pale,  cold,  grey  con- \nceptional  networks  which  they  threw  over  the  motley  whirl \nof  the  senses — the  mob  of  the  senses,  as  Plato  said.  In  this \novercoming  of  the  world,  and  interpreting  of  the  world  in \nthe  manner  of  Plato,  there  was  an  enjoyment  different  from \nthat  which  the  physicists  of  to-day  offer  us — and  likewise \nthe  Darwinists  and  antiteleologists  among  the  physiological \n1 6  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nworkers,  with  their  principle  of  the  \"smallest  possible  effort,\" \nand  the  greatest  possible  blunder.  \"Where  there  is  nothing \nmore  to  see  or  to  grasp,  there  is  also  nothing  more  for  men \nto  do\" — that  is  certainly  an  imperative  different  from  the \nPlatonic  one,  but  it  may  notwithstanding  be  the  right  im- \nperative for  a  hardy,  labourious  race  of  machinists  and \nbridge-builders  of  the  future,  who  have  nothing  but  rough \nwork  to  perform. \nIS \nTo  study  physiology  with  a  clear  conscience,  one  must \ninsist  on  the  fact  that  the  sense-organs  are  not  phenomena  in \nthe  sense  of  the  idealistic  philosophy;  as  such  they  certainly \ncould  not  be  causes!  Sensualism,  therefore,  at  least  as  regu- \nlative hypothesis,  if  not  as  heuristic  principle.  What?  And \n\n\nothers  say  even  that  the  external  world  is  the  work  of  our \norgans?  But  then  our  body,  as  a  part  of  this  external  world, \nwould  be  the  work  of  our  organs!  But  then  our  organs \nthemselves  would  be  the  work  of  our  organs!  It  seems  to \nme  that  this  is  a  complete  reductio  ad  absurdum,  if  the  con- \nception causa  sui  is  something  fundamentally  absurd.  Con- \nsequently, the  external  world  is  not  the  work  of  our  organs — ? \ni6 \nThere  are  still  harmless  self-observers  who  believe  that \nthere  are  \"immediate  certainties\";  for  instance,  \"I  think,\" \nor  as  the  superstition  of  Schopenhauer  puts  it,  \"I  will\";  as \nthough  cognition  here  got  hold  of  its  object  purely  and  simply \nas  \"the  thing  in  itself,\"  without  any  falsification  taking  place \neither  on  the  part  of  the  subject  or  the  object.  I  would \nrepeat  it,  however,  a  hundred  times,  that  \"immediate  cer- \nBEYOND   GOOD  AND  EVIL  17 \ntainty,\"  as  well  as  \"absolute  knowledge\"  and  the  \"thing  in \nitself,\"  involve  a  contradictio  in  adjecto;  we  really  ought  to \nfree  ourselves  from  the  misleading  significance  of  words! \nThe  people  on  their  part  may  think  that  cognition  is  knowing \nall  about  things,  but  the  philosopher  must  say  to  himself: \n\"When  I  analyse  the  process  that  is  expressed  in  the  sen- \ntence, 'I  think,'  I  find  a  whole  series  of  daring  assertions,  the \nargumentative  proof  of  which  would  be  difficult,  perhaps \nimpossible:  for  instance,  that  it  is  /  who  think,  that  there \nmust  necessarily  be  something  that  thinks,  that  thinking  is \nan  activity  and  operation  on  the  part  of  a  being  who  is \nthought  of  as  a  cause,  that  there  is  an  'ego,'  and  finally,  that \nit  is  already  determined  what  is  to  be  designated  by  thinking \n— that  I  know  what  thinking  is.

      "text": "Philosophers  are  accustomed  to  speak  of  the  will  as  though \nit  were  the  best-known  thing  in  the  world;  indeed,  Schopen- \nhauer has  given  us  to  understand  that  the  will  alone  is  really \nknown  to  us,  absolutely  and  completely  known,  without  de- \nduction or  addition.  But  it  again  and  again  seems  to  me  that \nin  this  case  Schopenhauer  also  only  did  what  philosophers  are \nin  the  habit  of  doing — he  seems  to  have  adopted  a  popular \nprejudice  and  exaggerated  it.  Willing — seems  to  me  to  be \nabove  all  something  complicated,  something  that  is  a  unity \nonly  in  name — and  it  is  precisely  in  a  name  that  popular \nprejudice  lurks,  which  has  got  the  mastery  over  the  inade- \nquate precautions  of  philosophers  in  all  ages.  So  let  us  for \nonce  be  more  cautious,  let  us  be  \"unphilosophical\":  let  us \nsay  that  in  all  willing  there  is  firstly  a  plurality  of  sensa- \ntions, namely,  the  sensation  of  the  condition  \"away  from \nwhich  we  go,\"  the  sensation  of  the  condition  \"towards  which \nwe  go,\"  the  sensation  of  this  \"from\"  and  \"towards\"  itself, \nand  then  besides,  an  accompanying  muscular  sensation, \nwhich,  even  without  our  putting  in  motion  \"arms  and  legs,\" \ncommences  its  action  by  force  of  habit,  directly  we  *'wiH\" \nanything.  Therefore,  just  as  sensations  (and  indeed  many \nkinds  of  sensations)  are  to  be  recognised  as  ingredients  of \nthe  will,  so,  in  the  second  place,  thinking  is  also  to  be  recog- \nnised; in  every  act  of  the  will  there  is  a  ruling  thought; — \nand  let  us  not  imagine  it  possible  to  sever  this  thought  from \nthe  \"willing,\"  as  if  the  will  would  then  remain  over!      In  the \n20  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nthird  place,  the  will  is  not  only  a  complex  of  sensation  and \nthinking,  but  it  is  above  all  an  emotion,  and  in  fact  the \nemotion  of  the  command.  That  which  is  termed  \"freedom \nof  the  will\"  is  essentially  the  emotion  of  supremacy  in  re- \nspect to  him  who  must  obey:  \"I  am  free,  'he'  must  obey\" — \nthis  consciousness  is  inherent  in  every  will;  and  equally  so \nthe  straining  of  the  attention,  the  straight  look  which  fixes \nitself  exclusively  on  one  thing,  the  unconditional  judgment \nthat  \"this  and  nothing  else  is  necessary  now,\"  the  inward \ncertainty  that  obedience  will  be  rendered — and  whatever  else \npertains  to  the  position  of  the  commander.  A  man  who  wills \ncommands  something  within  himself  which  renders  obedience, \nor  which  he  believes  renders  obedience.  But  now  let  us \nnotice  what  is  the  strangest  thing  about  the  will, — this  affair \nso  extremely  complex,  for  which  the  people  have  only  one \nname.  Inasmuch  as  in  the  given  circumstances  we  are  at  the \nsame  time  the  commanding  and  the  obeying  parties,  and  as \nthe  obe5dng  party  we  know  the  sensations  of  constraint,  im- \n\n\npulsion, pressure,  resistance,  and  motion,  which  usually  com- \nmence immediately  after  the  act  of  will;  inasmuch  as,  on  the \nother  hand,  we  are  accustomed  to  disregard  this  duality, \nand  to  deceive  ourselves  about  it  by  means  of  the  synthetic \nterm  \"I\":  a  whole  series  of  erroneous  conclusions,  and  con- \nsequently of  false  judgments  about  the  will  itself,  has  be- \ncome attached  to  the  act  of  willing — to  such  a  degree  that \nhe  who  wills  believes  firmly  that  willing  suffices  for  action. \nSince  fn  the  majority  of  cases  there  has  only  been  exercise  of \nwill  when  the  effect  of  the  command — consequently  obedi- \nence, and  therefore  action — was  to  be  expected,  the  appear- \nance has  translated  itself  into  the  sentiment,  as  if  there  were \na  necessity  of  effect;  in  a  word,  he  who  wills  believes  with \na  fair  amount  of  certainty  that  will  and  action  are  somehow \none;  he  ascribes  the  success,  the  carrying  out  of  the  willing, \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  21 \nto  the  will  itself,  and  thereby  enjoys  an  increase  of  the  sensa- \ntion of  power  which  accompanies  all  success.  \"Freedom  of \nWill\" — that  is  the  expression  for  the  complex  state  of  de- \nlight of  the  person  exercising  volition,  who  commands  and \nat  the  same  time  identifies  himself  with  the  executor  of  the \norder — who,  as  such,  enjoys  also  the  triumph  over  obstacles, \nbut  thinks  within  himself  that  it  was  really  his  own  will \nthat  overcame  them.  In  this  way  the  person  exercising  vo- \nlition adds  the  feelings  of  delight  of  his  successful  executive \ninstruments,  the  useful  \"underwills\"  or  under-souls — indeed, \nour  body  is  but  a  social  structure  composed  of  many  souls — ■ \nto  his  feelings  of  delight  as  commander.  L'effet  c'est  mot: \nwhat  happens  here  is  what  happens  in  every  well-constructed \nand  happy  commonwealth,  namely,  that  the  governing  class \nidentifies  itself  with  the  successes  of  the  commonwealth.

One  should  not  wrongly  mate- \nrialise  \"cause\"  and  \"effect,\"  as  the  natural  philosophers  da \n(and  whoever  like  them  naturalise  in  thinking  at  present), \naccording  to  the  prevailing  mechanical  doltishness  which \nmakes  the  cause  press  and  push  until  it  \"effects\"  its  end; \none  should  use  \"cause\"  and  \"effect\"  only  as  pure  concep- \ntions, that  is  to  say,  as  conventional  fictions  for  the  purpose \nof  designation  and  mutual  understanding, — not  for  explana- \ntion. In  \"being-in-itself\"  there  is  nothing  of  \"casual-con- \nnection,\" of  \"necessity,\"  or  of  \"psychological  non-freedom; \nthere  the  effect  does  not  follow  the  cause,  there  \"law\"  does \nnot  obtain.    It  is  we  alone  who  have  devised  cause,  sequence^ \n24  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nreciprocity,  relativity,  constraint,  number,  law,  freedom,  mo- \ntive, and  purpose;  and  when  we  interpret  and  intermix  this \nsymbol- world,  as  \"being  in  itself,\"  with  things,  we  act  once \nmore  as  we  have  always  acted — mythologically.  The  \"non- \nfree  will\"  is  mythology;  in  real  life  it  is  only  a  question  of \nstrong  and  weak  wills. — It  is  almost  always  a  symptom  of \nwhat  is  lacking  in  himself,  when  a  thinker,  in  every  \"casual- \nconnection\"  and  \"psychological  necessity,\"  manifests  some- \nthing of  compulsion,  indigence,  obsequiousness,  oppression, \nand  non-freedom;  it  is  suspicious  to  have  such  feelings — the \nperson  betrays  himself.  And  in  general,  if  I  have  observed \ncorrectly,  the  \"non-freedom  of  the  will\"  is  regarded  as  a \nproblem  from  two  entirely  opposite  standpoints,  but  always \nin  a  profoundly  personal  manner:  some  will  not  give  up \ntheir  \"responsibility,\"  their  belief  in  themselves,  the  personal \nright  to  their  merits,  at  any  price  (the  vain  races  belong  to \nthis  class) ;  others  on  the  contrary,  do  not  wish  to  be  answer- \nable for  anything,  or  blamed  for  anything,  and  owing  to  an \ninward  self-contempt,  seek  to  get  out  of  the  business,  no \nmatter  how.  The  latter,  when  they  write  books,  are  in  the \nhabit  at  present  of  taking  the  side  of  criminals;  a  sort  of \nsocialistic  sympathy  is  their  favourite  disguise.

The  martyrdom  of  the  philosopher,  his  \"sacri- \nfice for  the  sake  of  truth,\"  forces  into  the  light  whatever  of \nthe  agitator  and  actor  lurks  in  him;  and  if  one  has  hitherto \ncontemplated  him  only  with  artistic  curiosity,  with  regard \nto  many  a  philosopher  it  is  easy  to  understand  the  dangerous \ndesire  to  see  him  also  in  his  deterioration  (deteriorated  into  a \n\"martyr,\"  into  a  stage-  and  tribune-bawler) .

There  are \neven  cases  where  enchantment  mixes  with  the  disgust — \nnamely,  where  by  a  freak  of  nature,  genius  is  bound  to \nsome  such  indiscreet  billy-goat  and  ape,  as  in  the  case  of \nthe  Abbe  Galiani,  the  profoundest,  acutest,  and  perhaps  also \nfilthiest  man  of  his  century — he  was  far  profounder  than \nVoltaire,  and  consequently  also,  a  good  deal  more  silent. \nIt  happens  more  frequently,  as  has  been  hinted,  that  a  scien- \ntific head  is  placed  on  an  ape's  body,  a  fine  exceptional \nunderstanding  in  a  base  soul,  an  occurrence  by  no  means \nrare,  especially  amongst  doctors  and  moral  physiologists. \nAnd  whenever  anyone  speaks  without  bitterness,  or  rather \nquite  innocently  of  man,  as  a  belly  with  two  requirements, \nand  a  head  with  one;  whenever  any  one  sees,  seeks  and  wants \nto  see  only  hunger,  sexual  instinct,  and  vanity  as  the  real \nand  only  motives  of  human  actions;  in  short,  when  any  one \nspeaks  \"badly\" — and  not  even  \"ill\" — of  man,  then  ought  the \nlover  of  knowledge  to  hearken  attentively  and  diligently; \nhe  ought,  in  general,  to  have  an  open  ear  wherever  there  is \ntalk  without  indignation.

Let  us  call  this  period \nthe  pre-moral  period  of  mankind;  the  imperative,  \"know \nthyself!\"  was  then  still  unknown. — In  the  last  ten  thousand \nyears,  on  the  other  hand,  on  certain  large  portions  of  the \nearth,  one  has  gradually  got  so  far,  that  one  no  longer  lets \nthe  consequences  of  an  action,  but  its  origin,  decide  Vv'ith \nregard  to  its  worth:  a  great  achievement  as  a  whole,  an  im- \nportant refinement  of  vision  and  of  criterion,  the  uncon- \nscious effect  of  the  supremacy  of  aristocratic  values  and  of \nthe  belief  in  \"origin,\"  the  mark  of  a  period  which  may  be \ndesignated  in  the  narrower  sense  as  the  moral  one:  the  first \nattempt  at  self-knowledge  is  thereby  made.

To  be  sure,  an  ominous  new  superstition,  a \npeculiar  narrowness  of  interpretation,  attained  supremacy \nprecisely  thereby:  the  origin  of  an  action  was  interpreted \nin  the  most  definite  sense  possible,  as  origin  out  of  an \n\n\nintention;  people  were  agreed  in  the  belief  that  the  value  of \nan  action  lay  in  the  value  of  its  intention.  The  intention \nas  the  sole  origin  and  antecedent  history  of  an  action:  under \nthe  influence  of  this  prejudice  moral  praise  and  blame  have \nbeen  bestowed,  and  men  have  judged  and  even  philoso- \nphised almost  up  to  the  present  day. — Is  it  not  possible, \nhowever,  that  the  necessity  may  now  have  arisen  of  again \nmaking  up  our  minds  with  regard  to  the  reversing  and \nfundamental  shifting  of  values,  owing  to  a  new  self-con- \nsciousness and  acuteness  in  man — is  it  not  possible  that  we \nBEYOND   GOOD  AND  EVIL  39 \nmay  be  standing  on  the  threshold  of  a  period  which  to  be- \ngin with,  would  be  distinguished  negatively  as  ultra-moral: \nnowadays  when,  at  least  amongst  us  immoralists,  the  sus- \npicion arises  that  the  decisive  value  of  an  action  lies  pre- \ncisely in  that  which  is  not  intentional,  and  that  all  its  inten- \ntionalness,  all  that  is  seen,  sensible,  or  \"sensed\"  in  it,  be- \nlongs to  its  surface  or  skin — which,  like  every  sldn,  betrays \nsomething,  but  conceals  still  more?  In  short,  we  believe \nthat  the  intention  is  only  a  sign  or  symptom,  which  first \nrequires  an  explanation — a  sign,  moreover,  which  has  too \nmany  interpretations,  and  consequently  hardly  any  meaning \nin  itself  alone:  that  morality,  in  the  sense  in  which  it  has \nbeen  understood  hitherto,  as  intention-morality,  has  been  a \nprejudice,  perhaps  a  prematureness  or  preliminariness,  prob- \nably something  of  the  same  rank  as  astrology  and  alchemy, \nbut  in  any  case  something  which  must  be  surmounted. \nThe  surmounting  of  morality,  in  a  certain  sense  even  the \nself-mounting  of  morality — ^let  that  be  the  name  for  the \nlong  secret  labour  which  has  been  reserved  for  the  most  re- \nfined, the  most  upright,  and  also  the  most  wicked  con- \nsciences of  to-day,  as  the  living  touchstones  of  the  soul."

So  much \nmust  be  conceded:  there  could  have  been  no  life  at  all  ex- \ncept upon  the  basis  of  perspective  estimates  and  semblances; \nand  if,  with  the  virtuous  enthusiasm  and  stupidity  of  many \nphilosophers,  one  wished  to  do  away  altogether  with  the \n\"seeming  world\" — well,  granted  that  you  could  do  that, — \nat  least  nothing  of  your  \"truth\"  would  thereby  remain! \nIndeed,  what  is  it  that  forces  us  in  general  to  the  supposi- \ntion that  there  is  an  essential  opposition  of  \"true\"  and \n■\"false\"?  Is  it  not  enough  to  suppose  degrees  of  seeming- \nness,  and  as  it  were  lighter  and  darker  shades  and  tones  of \nsemblance — different  valeurs,  as  the  painters  say?  Why \nmight  not  the  world  which  concerns  us — be  a  fiction?  And \n.to  any  one  who  suggested:  \"But  to  a  fiction  belongs  an \noriginator?\" — might  it  not  be  bluntly  replied:  Why?  May \nnot  this  \"belong\"  also  belong  to  the  fiction?  Is  it  not  at \nlength  permitted  to  be  a  little  ironical  towards  the  subject, \njust  as  towards  the  predicate  and  object?     Might  not  the \n42  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nphilosopher  elevate  himself  above  faith  in  grammar?  All \nrespect  to  governesses,  but  is  it  not  time  that  philosc^hy \nshould  renounce  governess-faith?"

A  thing  could  be \ntrue,  although  it  were  in  the  highest  degree  injurious  and \ndangerous;  indeed,  the  fundamental  constitution  of  exist- \nence might  be  such  that  one  succumbed  by  a  full  knowledge \nof  it — so  that  the  strength  of  a  mind  might  be  measured  by \nthe  amount  of  \"truth\"  it  could  endure — or  to  speak  more \n\n\nplainly,  by  the  extent  to  which  it  required  truth  attenuated, \nveiled,  sweetened,  damped,  and  falsified.

Un  banquier,  qui  a  fait  fortune,  a  une  partie  du \ncaractere  requis  pour  faire  des  decouvertes  en  philosophie, \nc'est-d-dire  pour  voir  clair  dans  ce  qui  est.\" \nj^  Everything  that  is  profound  loves  the  mask:   the  pro- \nj  foundest  things  have  a  hatred  even  of  figure  and  likeness. \nShould  not  the  contrary  only  be  the  right  disguise  for  the \n46  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nshame  of  a  God  to  go  about  in?  A  question  worth  asking! — \nit  would  be  strange  if  some  mystic  has  not  already  ventured \non  the  same  kind  of  thing.  There  are  proceedings  of  such \na  delicate  nature  that  it  is  well  to  overwhelm  them  with \ncoarseness  and  make  them  unrecognisable;  there  are  ac- \ntions of  love  and  of  an  extravagant  magnanimity  after \nwhich  nothing  can  be  wiser  than  to  take  a  stick  and  thrash \nthe  witness  soundly:  one  thereby  obscures  his  recollection. \nMany  a  one  is  able  to  obscure  and  abuse  his  own  memory, \nin  order  at  least  to  have  vengeance  on  this  sole  party  in  the \nsecret:  shame  is  inventive.  They  are  not  the  worst  things \nof  which  one  is  most  ashamed:  there  is  not  only  deceit  be- \nhind a  mask — there  is  so  much  goodness  in  craft.  I  could \nimagine  that  a  man  with  something  costly  and  fragile  to \nconceal,  would  roll  through  life  clumsily  and  rotundly  like \nan  old,  green,  heavily-hooped  wine-cask:  the  refinement  of \nhis  shame  requiring  it  to  be  so.  A  man  who  has  depths  in \nhis  shame  meets  his  destiny  and  his  delicate  decisions  upon \npaths  which  few  ever  reach,  and  with  regard  to  the  exist- \n\n\nence of  which  his  nearest  and  most  intimate  friends  may \nbe  ignorant;  his  mortal  danger  conceals  itself  from  their  eyes, \nand  equally  so  his  regained  security.  Such  a  hidden  nature, \nwhich  instinctively  employs  speech  for  silence  and  conceal- \nment, and  is  inexhaustible  in  evasion  of  communication,  de- \nsires  and  insists  that  a  mask  of  himself  shall  occupy  his \nplace  in  the  hearts  and  heads  of  his  friends;  and  supposing \nhe  does  not  desire  it,  his  eyes  will  some  day  be  opened  to \nthe  fact  that  there  is  nevertheless  a  mask  of  him  there — and \nthat  it  is  well  to  be  so.  Every  profound  spirit  needs  a  mask; \nnay,  more,  around  every  profound  spirit  there  continually \ngrows  a  mask,  owing  to  the  constantly  false,  that  is  to  say, \nsuperficial  interpretation  of  every  word  he  utters,  every  step \nhe  takes,  every  sign  of  life  he  manifests. \nII \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  47"

      "text": "Wherever  the  religious  neurosis  has  appeared  on  the  earth \nso  far,  we  find  it  connected  with  three  dangerous  prescrip- \ntions as  to  regimen:  solitude,  fasting,  and  sexual  abstinence \n— but  without  its  being  possible  to  determine  with  certainty \nwhich  is  cause  and  which  is  effect,  or  if  any  relation  at  all  of \ncause  and  effect  exists  there.  This  latter  doubt  is  justified \nby  the  fact  that  one  of  the  most  regular  symptoms  among \nsavage  as  well  as  among  civilised  peoples  is  the  most  sudden \nand  excessive  sensuality;  which  then  with  equal  suddenness \ntransforms  into  penitential  paroxysms,  world-renunciation, \nand  will-renunciation:  both  symptoms  perhaps  explainable \nas  disguised  epilepsy?  But  nowhere  is  it  more  obligatory \nto  put  aside  explanations:  around  no  other  type  has  there \ngrown  such  a  mass  of  absurdity  and  superstition,  no  other \ntype  seems  to  have  been  more  interesting  to  men  and  even  to \nphilosophers — perhaps  it  is  time  to  become  just  a  little  in- \ndifferent here,  to  learn  caution,  or,  better  still,  to  look  away,. \nto  go  away. — Yet  in  the  background  of  the  most  recent \nphilosophy,  that  of  Schopenhauer,  we  find  almost  as  the \n■roblem  in  itself,  this  terrible  note  of  interrogation  of  the \nteligious  crisis  and  awakening.  How  is  the  negation  of  will \n^ssible?  how  is  the  saint  possible? — that  seems  to  have  been \n■le  very  question  with  which  Schopenhauer  made  a  start \nand  became  a  philosopher.  And  thus  it  was  a  genuine \nichopenhauerian  consequence,  that  his  most  convinced  ad- \nent  (perhaps  also  his  last,  as  far  as  Germany  is  con- \ned), namely,  Richard  Wagner,  should  bring  his  ovm \nwork  to  an  end  just  here,  and  should  finally  put  that \nible  and  eternal  type  upon  the  stage  as  Kundry,  type \nu,  and  as  it  loved  and  lived,  at  the  very  time  that  the \n\n\n56  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nmad-doctors  in  almost  all  European  countries  had  an  oppor- \ntunity to  study  the  type  close  at  hand,  wherever  the  reli- \ngious neurosis — or  as  I  call  it,  \"the  religious  mood\" — made \nits  latest  epidemical  outbreak  and  display  as  the  \"Salvation \nArmy.\" — If  it  be  a  question,  however,  as  to  what  has  been \nso  extremely  interesting  to  men  of  all  sorts  in  all  ages,  and \neven  to  philosophers,  in  the  whole  phenomenon  of  the  saint, \nit  is  undoubtedly  the  appearance  of  the  miraculous  therein \n— ^namely,  the  immediate  succession  of  opposites,  of  states \nof  the  soul  regarded  as  morally  antithetical:  it  was  believed \nhere  to  be  self-evident  that  a  \"bad  man\"  was  all  at  once \nturned  into  a  \"saint,\"  a  good  man.  The  hitherto  existing \npsychology  was  wrecked  at  this  point;  is  it  not  possible  it \nmay  have  happened  principally  because  psychology  had \nplaced  itself  under  the  dominion  of  morals,  because  it  be- \nlieved in  oppositions  of  moral  values,  and  saw,  read,  and \ninterpreted  these  oppositions  into  the  text  and  facts  of  the \ncase?  What?  \"Miracle\"  only  an  error  of  interpretation? \nA  lack  of  philology?"

It  is  the  profound,  suspicious  fear  of  an  in- \ncurable pessimism  which  compels  whole  centuries  to  fasten \ntheir  teeth  into  a  religious  interpretation  of  existence:  the \nfear  of  the  instinct  which  divines  that  truth  might  be  at- \ntained too  soon,  before  man  has  become  strong  enough,  hard \nenough,  artist  enough.  .  .  .  Piety,  the  \"Life  in  God,\"  re- \ngarded in  this  light,  would  appear  as  the  most  elaborate  and \nultimate  product  of  the  fear  of  truth,  as  artist-adoration  and \nartist-intoxication  in  presence  of  the  most  logical  of  all  falsi- \nfications, as  the  will  to  the  inversion  of  truth,  to  imtruth  at \nany  price.  Perhaps  there  has  hitherto  been  no  more  effective \nmeans  of  beautifying  man  than  piety;  by  means  of  it  man \ncan  become  so  artful,  so  superficial,  so  iridescent,  and  so \ngood,  that  his  appearance  no  longer  offends."

The \nselecting  and  disciplining  influence — destructive,  as  well  as \ncreative  and  fashioning — which  can  be  exercised  by  means  of \n\n\nreligion  is  manifold  and  varied,  according  to  the  sort  of \npeople  placed  under  its  spell  and  protection.  For  those \nwho  are  strong  and  independent,  destined  and  trained  to \ncommand,  in  whom  the  judgment  and  skill  of  a  ruling  race \nis  incorporated,  religion  is  an  additional  means  for  overcom- \ning resistance  in  the  exercise  of  authority — as  a  bond  which \nbinds  rulers  and  subjects  in  common,  betraying  and  sur- \nrendering to  the  former  the  conscience  of  the  latter,  their  in- \nmost heart,  which  would  fain  escape  obedience.  And  in  the \ncase  of  the  unique  natures  of  noble  origin,  if  by  virtue  of \niperior  spirituality  they  should  incline  to  a  more  retired  and \n>ntemplative  life,  reserving  to  themselves  only  the  more \nined  forms  of  government  (over  chosen  disciples  or  mem- \ners  of  an  order),  religion  itself  may  be  used  as  a  means  for \n)taining  peace  from  the  noise  and  trouble  of  managing \nrosser  affairs,  and  for  securing  immxmity  from  the  unavoid- \n68  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nable  filth  of  all  political  agitation.  The  Brahmins,  for  in- \nstance, understood  this  fact.  With  the  help  of  a  religious \norganisation,  they  secured  to  themselves  the  power  of  nomi- \nnating kings  for  the  people,  while  their  sentiments  prompted \nthem  to  keep  apart  and  outside,  as  men  with  a  higher  zind \nsuper-regal  mission.  At  the  same  time  religion  gives  induce- \nment and  opportunity  to  some  of  the  subjects  to  qualify \nthemselves  for  future  ruling  and  commanding:  the  slowly \nascending  ranks  and  classes,  in  which,  through  fortimate \nmarriage  customs,  volitional  power  and  delight  in  self-control \nare  on  the  increase.  To  them  religion  offers  sufficient  incen- \ntives and  temptations  to  aspire  to  higher  intellectuality,  and \nto  experience  the  sentiments  of  authoritative  self-control,  of \nsilence,  and  of  solitude.  Asceticism  and  Puritanism  are \nalmost  indispensable  means  of  educating  and  ennobling  a \nrace  which  seeks  to  rise  above  its  hereditary  baseness  and \nwork  itself  upward  to  future  supremacy.  And  finally,  to \nordinary  men,  to  the  majority  of  the  people,  who  exist  for \nservice  and  general  utility,  and  are  only  so  far  entitled  to \nexist,  religion  gives  invaluable  contentedness  with  their  lot \nand  condition,  peace  of  heart,  ennoblement  of  obedience,  ad- \nditional social  happiness  and  sympathy,  with  something  of \ntransfiguration  and  embellishment,  something  of  justification \nof  all  the  commonplaceness,  all  the  meanness,  all  the  semi- \nanimal  poverty  of  their  souls.  Religion,  together  with  the \nreligious  significance  of  life,  sheds  sunshine  over  such  per-, \npetually  harassed  men,  and  makes  even  their  own  aspect  enjj \ndurable  to  them;  it  operates  upon  them  as  the  EpicureaiC \nphilosophy  usually  operates  upon  sufferers  of  a  higher  order, \nin  a  refreshing  and  refining  manner,  almost  turning  suffering \n\n\nto  account,  and  in  the  end  even  halloing  and  vindicating  it \nThere  is  perhaps  nothing  so  admirable  in  Christianity  an^ \nBuddhism  as  their  art  of  teaching  even  the  lowest  to  elevat \nBEYOND   GOOD  AND   EVIL  69 \nthemselves  by  piety  to  a  seemingly  higher  order  of  things, \nand  thereby  to  retain  their  satisfaction  with  the  actual  world \nin  which  they  find  it  difficult  enough  to  live — this  very  diffi- \nculty being  necessary."

Among  men,  as  among  all \nother  animals,  there  is  a  surplus  of  defective,  diseased,  degen- \nerating, infirm,  and  necessarily  suffering  individuals;  the \nsuccessful  cases,  among  men  also,  are  always  the  exception; \nand  in  view  of  the  fact  that  man  is  the  animal  not  yet  prop- \nerly adapted  to  his  environment,  the  rare  exception.  But \nworse  still.  The  higher  the  type  a  man  represents,  the \ngreater  is  the  improbability  that  he  will  succeed;  the  acci- \ndental, the  law  of  irrationality  in  the  general  constitution  of \nmcmkind,  manifests  itself  most  terribly  in  its  destructive  ef- \nfect on  the  higher  orders  of  men,  the  conditions  of  whose \nlives  are  delicate,  diverse,  and  difficult  to  determine.  What, \nthen,  is  the  attitude  of  the  two  greatest  religions  above-men- \ntioned to  the  surplus  of  failures  in  life?  They  endeavour  to \npreserve  and  keep  alive  whatever  can  be  preserved;  in  fact, \nas  the  religions  for  sufferers,  they  take  the  part  of  these  upon \nprinciple;  they  are  always  in  favour  of  those  who  suffer \nfrom  life  as  from  a  disease,  and  they  would  fain  treat  every \nother  experience  of  life  as  false  and  impossible.

One \n\n\nhas  to  thank  them  for  invaluable  services;  and  who  is  suffi- \nciently rich  in  gratitude  not  to  feel  poor  at  the  contemplation \nof  all  that  the  \"spiritual  men\"  of  Christianity  have  done  for \nEurope  hitherto!  But  when  they  had  given  comfort  to  the \nsufferers,  courage  to  the  oppressed  and  despairing,  a  staff  and \nsupport  to  the  helpless,  and  when  they  had  allured  from  so- \nciety into  convents  and  spiritual  penitentiaries  the  broken- \nhearted and  distracted:  what  else  had  they  to  do  in  order \nto  work  systematically  in  that  fashion,  and  with  a  good  con- \nscience, for  the  preservation  of  all  the  sick  and  suffering, \nwhich  means,  in  deed  and  in  truth,  to  work  for  the  deteriora- \ntion of  the  European  race?  To  reverse  all  estimates  of \nvalue — that  is  what  they  had  to  do!  And  to  shatter  the \nstrong,  to  spoil  great  hopes,  to  cast  suspicion  on  the  delight \nin  beauty,  to  break  down  everything  autonomous,  manly, \nconquering,  and  imperious — all  instincts  which  are  natural \nto  the  highest  and  most  successful  type  of  \"man\" — into  un- \ncertainty, distress  of  conscience,  and  self-destruction;  for- \nsooth, to  invert  all  love  of  the  earthly  and  of  supremacy \nover  the  earth,  into  hatred  of  the  earth  and  earthly  things — \nthat  is  the  task  the  Church  imposed  on  itself,  and  was  obliged \nto  impose,  until,  according,  to  its  standard  of  value,  \"un- \nworldliness,\"  \"unsensuousness,\"  and  \"higher  man\"  fused  into \ncMie  sentiment.

Indeed,  the  expression,  \"Science  of  Morals\"  is, \nin  respect  to  what  is  designated  thereby,  far  too  presumptu- \nous and  counter  to  good  taste, — ^which  is  always  a  fore- \ntaste of  more  modest  expressions.  One  ought  to  avow  with \nthe  utmost  fairness  what  is  still  necessary  here  for  a  long \ntime,  what  is  alone  proper  for  the  present:  namely,  the \ncollection  of  material,  the  comprehensive  survey  and  classi- \nfication of  an  immense  domain  of  delicate  sentiments  of \nworth,  and  distinctions  of  worth,  which  live,  grow,  propagate, \nand  perish — and  perhaps  attempts  to  give  a  clear  idea  of \nthe  recurring  and  more  common  forms  of  these  living  crystal- \nlisations— as  preparation  for  a  theory  of  types  of  morality. \nTo  be  sure,  people  have  not  hitherto  been  so  modest.  All \nthe  philosophers,  with  a  pedantic  and  ridiculous  seriousness, \ndemanded  of  themselves  something  very  much  higher,  more \npretentious,  and  ceremonious,  when  they  concerned  them- \n\n\ny4 \nBEYOND   GOOD  AND  EVIL  95 \nselves  with  morality  as  a  science:  they  wanted  to  give  a  basis \nto  morality — and  every  philosopher  hitherto  has  believed \nthat  he  has  given  it  a  basis;  morality  itself,  however,  has \nbeen  regarded  as  something  \"given.\"  How  far  from  their \nawkward  pride  was  the  seemingly  insignificant  problem — \nleft  in  dust  and  decay — of  a  description  of  forms  of  morality, \nnotwithstanding  that  the  finest  hands  and  senses  could  hardly \nbe  fine  enough  for  it!  It  was  precisely  owing  to  moral  phi- \nlosophers knowing  the  moral  facts  imperfectly,  in  an  arbi- \ntrary epitome,  or  an  accidental  abridgement — perhaps  as \nthe  morality  of  their  environment,  their  position,  their  church, \ntheir  Zeitgeist,  their  climate  and  zone — it  was  precisely  be- \ncause they  were  badly  instructed  with  regard  to  nations, \neras,  and  past  ages,  and  were  by  no  means  eager  to  know \nabout  these  matters,  that  they  did  not  even  come  in  sight \nof  the  real  problems  of  morals — problems  which  only  disclose \nthemselves  by  a  comparison  of  many  kinds  of  morality.  In \nevery  \"Science  of  Morals\"  hitherto,  strange  as  it  may  sound, \nthe  problem  of  morality  itself  has  been  omitted;  there  has \nbeen  no  suspicion  that  there  was  anything  problematic  there! \nThat  which  philosophers  called  \"giving  a  basis  to  morality,\" \nand  endeavoured  to  realise,  has,  when  seen  in  a  right  light, \nproved  merely  a  learned  form  of  good  faith  in  prevailing \nmorality,  a  new  means  of  its  expression,  consequently  just  a \nmatter-of-fact  within  the  sphere  of  a  definite  morality,  yea, \nin  its  ultimate  motive,  a  sort  of  denial  that  it  is  lawful  for \nthis  morality  to  be  called  in  question — and  in  any  case  the \nreverse  of  the  testing,  analysing,  doubting,  and  vivisecting \nof  this  very  faith.  Hear,  for  instance,  with  what  innocence \n— almost  worthy  of  honour — Schopenhauer  represents  his \nown  task,  and  draw  your  conclusions  concerning  the  scien- \ntificness  of  a  \"Science\"  whose  latest  master  still  talks  in \nthe  strain  of  children  and  old  wives:  \"The  principle,\"  he \n96  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nsays  (page  136  of  the  Grundprobleme  der  Ethik*),  \"the \naxiom  about  the  purport  of  which  all  moralists  are  practically \nagreed:  neminem  laede,  immo  omnes  quantum  potes  juva — \nis  really  the  proposition  which  all  moral  teachers  strive  to \nestablish,  .  .  .  the  real  basis  of  ethics  which  has  been  sought, \nlike  the  philosopher's  stone,  for  centuries.\" — The  difficulty  of \nestablishing  the  proposition  referred  to  may  indeed  be  great \n\n\n— it  is  well  known  that  Schopenhauer  also  was  imsuccessful \nin  his  efforts;  and  whoever  has  thoroughly  realised  how \nabsurdly  false  and  sentimental  this  proposition  is,  in  a  world \nwhose  essence  is  Will  to  Power,  may  be  reminded  that \nSchopenhauer,  although  a  pessimist,  actually — played  the \nflute  .  .  .  daily  after  dinner:  one  may  read  about  the  matter \nin  his  biography.  A  question  by  the  way:  a  pessimist,  a \nrepudiator  of  God  and  of  the  world,  who  makes  a  halt  at \nmorality — who  assents  to  morality,  and  plays  the  flute  to \nlaede-neminem  moraJs,  what?

What  is  essential  and \ninvaluable  in  every  system  of  morals,  is  that  it  is  a  long \nconstraint.  In  order  to  understand  Stoicism,  or  Port-Royal, \nor  Puritanism,  one  should  remember  the  constraint  under \nwhich  every  language  has  attained  to  strength  and  freedom — \n\n\nthe  metrical  constraint,  the  tyranny  of  rhyme  and  rhythm. \nHow  much  trouble  have  the  poets  and  orators  of  every  nation \ngiven  themselves! — not  excepting  some  of  the  prose  writers \nof  to-day,  in  whose  ear  dwells  an  inexorable  conscientious- \nness— \"for  the  sake  of  a  folly,\"  as  utilitarian  bunglers  say, \nand  thereby  deem  themselves  wise — \"from  submission  to \narbitrary  laws,\"  as  the  anarchists  say,  and  thereby  fancy \nthemselves  \"free,\"  even  free-spirited.  The  singular  fact  re- \nmains, however,  that  everything  of  the  nature  of  freedom, \nelegance,  boldness,  dance,  and  masterly  certainty,  which  ex- \nists or  has  existed,  whether  it  be  in  thought  itself,  or  in \nadministration,  or  in  speaking  and  persuading,  in  art  just \nas  in  conduct,  has  only  developed  by  means  of  the  tyranny \nof  such  arbitrary  law;  and  in  all  seriousness,  it  is  not  at  all \nimprobable  that  precisely  this  is  \"nature\"  and  \"natural\" — \n98  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nand  not  laisser-aller !  Every  artist  knows  how  different  from \nthe  state  of  letting  himself  go,  is  his  \"most  natural\"  condition, \nthe  free  arranging,  locating,  disposing,  and  constructing  in \nthe  moments  of  \"inspiration\" — and  how  strictly  and  deli- \ncately he  then  obeys  a  thousand  laws,  which,  by  their  very \nrigidness  and  precision,  defy  all  formulation  by  means  of \nideas  (even  the  most  stable  idea  has,  in  comparison  there- \nwith, something  floating,  manifold,  and  ambiguous  in  it). \nThe  essential  thing  \"in  heaven  and  in  earth\"  is,  apparently \n(to  repeat  it  once  more),  that  there  should  be  long  obedience \nin  the  same  direction;  there  thereby  results,  and  has  always \nresulted  in  the  long  run,  something  which  has  made  life \nworth  living;  for  instance,  virtue,  art,  music,  dancing,  rea- \nson, spirituality — anything  whatever  that  is  transfiguring, \nrefined,  foolish,  or  divine.  The  long  bondage  of  the  spirit, \nthe  distrustful  constraint  in  the  communicability  of  ideas, \nthe  discipline  which  the  thinker  imposed  on  himself  to  think \nin  accordance  with  the  rules  of  a  church  or  a  court,  or \nconformable  to  Aristotelian  premises,  the  persistent  spiritual \nwill  to  interpret  everything  that  happened  according  to  a \nChristian  scheme,  and  in  every  occurrence  to  rediscover  and \njustify  the  Christian  God: — all  this  violence,  arbitrariness, \nseverity,  dreadfulness,  and  unreasonableness,  has  proved  it- \nself the  disciplinary  means  whereby  the  European  spirit  has \nattained  its  strength,  its  remorseless  curiosity  and  subtle \nmobility;  granted  also  that  much  irrecoverable  strength  and \nspirit  had  to  be  stifled,  suffocated,  and  spoilt  in  the  process] \n(for  here,  as  everywhere,  \"nature\"  shows  herself  as  she  is,l \nin  all  her  extravagant  and  indifferent  magnificence,  which, \nis  shocking,  but  nevertheless  noble).  That  for  centuries] \nEuropean  thinkers  only  thought  in  order  to  prove  somethingj \n\n\n— nowadays,  on  the  contrary,  we  are  suspicious  of  everyj \nthinker  who  \"wishes  to  prove  something\" — that  it  was  alwa) \nBEYOND   GOOD  AND  EVIL  99 \nsettled  beforehand  what  was  to  be  the  result  of  their  strictest \nthinking,  as  it  was  perhaps  in  the  Asiatic  astrology  of  former \ntimes,  or  as  it  is  still  at  the  present  day  in  the  innocent, \nChristian-moral  explanation  of  immediate  personal  events \n\"for  the  glory  of  God,\"  or  \"for  the  good  of  the  soul\":— this \ntyranny,  this  arbitrariness,  this  severe  and  magnificent  stupid- \nity, has  educated  the  spirit;  slavery,  both  in  the  coarser  and \nthe  finer  sense,  is  apparently  an  indispensable  means  even \nof  spiritual  education  and  discipline.  One  may  look  at  every \nsystem  of  morals  in  this  light:  it  is  \"nature\"  therein  which \nteaches  to  hate  the  laisser-aller,  the  too  great  freedom,  and \nimplants  the  need  for  limited  horizons,  for  immediate  duties \n— ^it  teaches  the  narrowing  of  perspectives,  and  thus,  in  a \ncertain  sense,  that  stupidity  is  a  condition  of  life  and  develop- \nment. \"Thou  must  obey  some  one,  and  for  a  long  time; \notherwise  thou  wilt  come  to  grief,  and  lose  all  respect  for \nthyself\" — this  seems  to  me  to  be  the  moral  imperative  of  na- \nture, which  is  certainly  neither  \"categorical,\"  as  old  Kant \nwished  (consequently  the  \"otherwise\"),  nor  does  it  address \nitself  to  the  individual  (what  does  nature  care  for  the  in- \ndividual!), but  to  nations,  races,  ages,  and  ranks,  above  all, \nhowever,  to  the  animal  \"man\"  generally,  to  mankind."

The  extraordinary  limitation \nof  human  development,  the  hesitation,  protractedness,  fre- \nquent retrogression,  and  turning  thereof,  is  attributable  to \nthe  fact  that  the  herd-instinct  of  obedience  is  transmitted \nbest,  and  at  the  cost  of  the  art  of  command.  If  one  imagine \nthis  instinct  increasing  to  its  greatest  extent,  commanders \nand  independent  individuals  will  finally  be  lacking  alto- \ngether; or  they  will  suffer  inwardly  from  a  bad  conscience, \nand  will  have  to  impose  a  deception  on  themselves  in  the \nfirst  place  in  order  to  be  able  to  command:  just  as  if  they \nalso  were  only  obeying.  This  condition  of  things  actually \nexists  in  Europe  at  present — I  call  it  the  moral  hypocrisy  of \nthe  commanding  class.  They  know  no  other  way  of  protect- \ning themselves  from  their  bad  conscience  than  by  playing  the \nno  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nrole  of  executors  of  older  and  higher  orders  (of  predecessors, \nof  the  constitution,  of  justice,  of  the  law,  or  of  God  himself) , \nor  they  even  justify  themselves  by  maxims  from  the  current \nopinions  of  the  herd,  as  \"first  servants  of  their  people,\"  or \n\"instruments  of  the  public  weal.\"  On  the  other  hand,  the \ngregarious  European  man  nowadays  assumes  an  air  as  if \nhe  were  the  only  land  of  man  that  is  allowable;  he  glorifies \nhis  qualities,  such  as  public  spirit,  kindness,  deference,  in- \ndustry, temperance,  modesty,  indulgence,  S5mipathy,  by \nvirtue  of  which  he  is  gentle,  endurable,  and  useful  to  the \nherd,  as  the  peculiarly  human  virtues.  In  cases,  however, \nwhere  it  is  believed  that  the  leader  and  bell-wether  cannot \nbe  dispensed  with,  attempt  after  attempt  is  made  nowadays \nto  replace  commanders  by  the  summing  together  of  clever \ngregarious  men:  all  representative  constitutions,  for  example, \nare  of  this  origin.  In  spite  of  all,  what  a  blessing,  what  a \ndeliverance  from  a  weight  becoming  unendurable,  is  the \nappearance  of  an  absolute  ruler  for  these  gregarious  Euro- \npeans—of this  fact  the  effect  of  the  appearance  of  Napoleon \nwas  the  last  great  proof:  the  history  of  the  influence  of \nNapoleon  is  almost  the  history  of  the  higher  happiness  to \nwhich  the  entire  century  has  attained  in  its  worthiest  indi- \nviduals and  periods."

We  know  well  enough \nhow  offensively  it  sounds  when  any  one  plainly,  and  without \nmetaphor,  counts  man  amongst  the  animals;  but  it  will  be \naccounted  to  us  almost  a  crime,  that  it  is  precisely  in  respect \nto  men  of  \"modem  ideas\"  that  we  have  constantly  applied \nthe  terms  \"herd,\"  \"herd-instincts,\"  and  such  like  expressions. \nWhat  avail  is  it?  We  cannot  do  otherwise,  for  it  is  precisely \nhere  that  our  new  insight  is.  We  have  found  that  in  all  the \nprincipal  moral  judgments  Europe  has  become  unanimous, \nincluding  likewise  the  countries  where  European  influence \nprevails:  in  Europe  people  evidently  know  what  Socrates \nthought  he  did  not  know,  and  what  the  famous  serpent  of \nold  once  promised  to  teach — they  \"know\"  to-day  what  is \n\n\ngood  and  evil.  It  must  then  sound  hard  and  be  distasteful  to \nthe  ear,  when  we  always  insist  that  that  which  here  thinks \nit  knows,  that  which  here  glorifies  itself  with  praise  and \nblame,  and  calls  itself  good,  is  the  instinct  of  the  herding \nhuman  animal:  the  instinct  which  has  come  and  is  ever \ncoming  more  and  more  to  the  front,  to  preponderance  and \nsupremacy  over  other  instincts,  according  to  the  increasing \nphysiological  approximation  and  resemblance  of  which  it  is \nthe  S5miptom.     Morality  in  Europe  at  present  is  herding- \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  115 \nanimal  morality;  and  therefore,  as  we  understand  the  matter, \nonly  one  kind  of  human  morality,  beside  which,  before  which, \nand  after  v/hich  many  other  moralities,  and  above  all  higher \nmoralities,  are  or  should  be  possible.  Against  such  a  \"possi- \nbility,\" against  such  a  \"should  be,\"  however,  this  morality \ndefends  itself  with  all  its  strength;  it  says  obstinately  and \ninexorably:  \"I  am  morality  itself  and  nothing  else  is  moral- \nity!\" Indeed,  with  the  help  of  a  religion  which  has \nhumoured  and  flattered  the  sublimest  desires  of  the  herd- \ning-animal,  things  have  reached  such  a  point  that  we  always \nfind  a  more  visible  expression  of  this  morality  even  in \npolitical  and  social  arrangements:  the  democratic  move- \nment is  the  inheritance  of  the  Christian  movement.  That \nits  tempo,  however,  is  much  too  slow  and  sleepy  for  the \nmore  impatient  ones,  for  those  who  are  sick  and  distracted \nby  the  herding-instinct,  is  indicated  by  the  increasingly \nfurious  howling,  and  always  less  disguised  teeth-gnashing \nof  the  anarchist  dogs,  who  are  now  roving  through  the  high- \nways of  European  culture.  Apparently  in  opposition  to  the \npeacefully  industrious  democrats  and  Revolution-ideologues, \nand  still  more  so  to  the  awkward  philosophasters  and  frater- \nnity-visionaries who  call  themselves  Socialists  and  want  a \n\"free  society,\"  those  are  really  at  one  with  them  all  in  their \nthorough  and  instinctive  hostility  to  every  form  of  society \nother  than  that  of  the  autonomous  herd  (to  the  extent  even \nof  repudiating  the  notions  \"master\"  and  \"servant\" — ni  dieu \nni  maitre,  says  a  socialist  formula) ;  at  one  in  their  tenacious \nopposition  to  every  special  claim,  every  special  right  and \nprivilege  (this  means  ultimately  opposition  to  every  right, \nfor  when  all  are  equal,  no  one  needs  \"rights\"  any  longer) ; \nat  one  in  their  distrust  of  punitive  justice  (as  though  it  were \na  \\dolation  of  the  weak,  imfair  to  the  necessary  consequences \nof  all  former  society) ;  but  equally  at  one  in  their  religion  of \n/ \n\n\nii6  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nsympathy,  in  their  compassion  for  all  that  feels,  lives,  and \nsuffers  (down  to  the  very  animals,  up  even  to  \"God\" — the \nextravagance  of  \"sympathy  for  God\"  belongs  to  a  democratic \nage) ;  altogether  at  one  in  the  cry  and  impatience  of  their \nsympathy,  in  their  deadly  hatred  of  suffering  generally,  in \ntheir  almost  feminine  incapacity  for  witnessing  it  or  allowing \nit;  at  one  in  their  involuntary  beglooming  and  heart-soften- \ning, under  the  spell  of  which  Europe  seems  to  be  threatened \nwith  a  new  Buddhism;  at  one  in  their  belief  in  the  morality \nof  mutual  sympathy,  as  though  it  were  morality  in  itself,  the \nclimax,  the  attained  climax  of  mankind,  the  sole  hope  of  the \nfuture,  the  consolation  of  the  present,  the  great  discharge \nfrom  all  the  obligations  of  the  past;  altogether  at  one  in \ntheir  belief  in  the  community  as  the  deliverer,  in  the  herd, \nand  therefore  in  \"themselves.\""

The  extent \nand  towering  structure  of  the  sciences  have  increased  enor- \nmously, and  therewith  also  the  probability  that  the  philoso- \npher will  grow  tired  even  as  a  learner,  or  will  attach  himself \nsomewhere  and  \"specialise\":  so  that  he  will  no  longer  attain \nto  his  elevation,  that  is  to  say,  to  his  superspection,  his  cir- \ncumspection, and  his  despection.  Or  he  gets  aloft  too  late, \nwhen  the  best  of  his  maturity  and  strength  is  past;  or  when \nhe  is  impaired,  coarsened,  and  deteriorated,  so  that  his  view, \nhis  general  estimate  of  things,  is  no  longer  of  much  import- \n,  ance.  It  is  perhaps  just  the  refinement  of  his  intellectual \nconscience  that  makes  him  hesitate  and  linger  on  the  way; \nhe  dreads  the  temptation  to  become  a  dilettante,  a  millepede, \na  milleantenna;  he  knows  too  well  that  as  a  discerner,  one \nwho  has  lost  his  self-respect  no  longer  commands,  no  longer \nleads;  unless  he  should  aspire  to  become  a  great  play-actor \na  philosophical  Cagliostro  and  spiritual  rat-catcher — in  short, \na  misleader.

Let  us  examine  more  closely:  what  is \nthe  scientific  man?  Firstly,  a  commonplace  type  of  man, \nwith  commonplace  virtues:  that  is  to  say,  a  non-ruling,  non- \nauthoritative,  and  non-self-sufficient  type  of  man;  he  pos- \nsesses industry,  patient  adaptableness  to  rank  and  file,  equa- \nbility and  moderation  in  capacity  and  requirement;  he  has \nthe  instinct  for  people  like  himself,  and  for  that  which  they \nrequire — for  instance:  the  portion  of  independence  and  green \nmeadow  without  which  there  is  no  rest  from  labour,  the \nclaim  to  honour  and  consideration  (which  first  and  foremost \npresupposes  recognition  and  recognisability) ,  the  sunshine \nof  a  good  name,  the  perpetual  ratification  of  his  value  and \nusefulness,  with  which  -the  inward  distrust  which  lies  at  the \nbottom  of  the  heart  of  all  dependent  men  and  gregarious \nanimals,  has  again  and  again  to  be  overcome.  The  learned \nman,  as  is  appropriate,  has  also  maladies  and  faults  of  an \nignoble  kind:  he  is  full  of  petty  envy,  and  has  a  lynx-eye \n\n\nfor  the  weak  points  in  those  natures  to  whose  elevations \nhe  cannot  attain.

To  relax,  of \ncourse,  with  consideration,  and  naturally  with  an  indulgent \nhand — to  relax  with  confiding  sympathy:  that  is  the  real \nart  of  Jesuitism,  which  has  always  understood  how  to  intro- \nduce itself  as  the  religion  of  sympathy.

He  is  only  an  instrument;  we  may  say,  he \nis  a  mirror — ^he  is  no  ''purpose  in  himself.\"  The  objective \nman  is  in  truth  a  mirror:  accustomed  to  prostration  before \neverything  that  wants  to  be  known,  with  such  desires  only \nas  knowing  or  \"reflecting\"  imply — ^he  waits  until  something \ncomes,  and  then  expands  himself  sensitively,  so  that  even \nthe  light  footsteps  and  gliding  past  of  spiritual  beings  may \nnot  be  lost  on  his  surface  and  film.  Whatever  \"personality\" \nhe  still  possesses  seems  to  him  accidental,  arbitrary,  or  still \noftener,  disturbing;  so  much  has  he  come  to  regard  himself \nas  the  passage  and  reflection  of  outside  forms  and  events. \nHe  calls  up  the  recollection  of  \"himself\"  with  an  effort,  and \nnot  infrequently  wrongly;  he  readily  confounds  himself  with \n\n\nother  persons,  he  makes  mistakes  with  regard  to  his  own \nneeds,  and  here  only  is  he  unrefined  and  negligent.    Perhaps \n126  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nhe  is  troubled  about  the  health,  or  the  pettiness  and  confined \natmosphere  of  wife  and  friend,  or  the  lack  of  companions \nand  society — indeed,  he  sets  himself  to  reflect  on  his  suffer- \ning, but  in  vain!  His  thoughts  already  rove  away  to  the \nmore  general  case,  and  to-morrow  he  knows  as  little  as  he \nknew  yesterday  how  to  help  himself.  He  does  not  now  take \nhimself  seriously  and  devote  time  to  himself:  he  is  serene, \nnot  from  lack  of  trouble,  but  from  lack  of  capacity  for \ngrasping  and  dealing  with  his  trouble.  The  habitual  com- \nplaisance with  respect  to  all  objects  and  experiences,  the \nradiant  and  impartial  hospitality  with  which  he  receives \neverything  that  comes  his  way,  his  habit  of  inconsiderate \ngood-nature,  of  dangerous  indifference  as  to  Yea  and  Nay: \nalas!  there  are  enough  of  cases  in  which  he  has  to  atone  for \nthese  virtues  of  his! — and  as  man  generally,  he  becomes  far \ntoo  easily  the  caput  mortuum  of  such  virtues.  Should  one \nwish  love  or  hatred  from  him — I  mean  love  and  hatred  as \nGod,  woman,  and  animal  understand  them — he  will  do  what \nhe  can,  and  furnish  what  he  can.  But  one  must  not  be \nsurprised  if  it  should  not  be  much — if  he  should  show  him- \nself just  at  this  point  to  be  false,  fragile,  questionable,  and \ndeteriorated.  His  love  is  constrained,  his  hatred  is  artificial, \nand  rather  un  tour  de  force,  a  slight  ostentation  and  exag- \ngeration. He  is  only  genuine  so  far  as  he  can  be  objective; \nonly  in  his  serene  totality  is  he  still  \"nature\"  and  \"natural.\" \nHis  mirroring  and  eternally  self-polishing  soul  no  longer \nknows  how  to  affirm,  no  longer  how  to  deny;  he  does  not \ncommand;  neither  does  he  destroy.  \"Je  ne  tniprise  presque \nrien\" — he  says,  with  Leibnitz:  let  us  not  overlook  nor  under- \nvalue the  presque!  Neither  is  he  a  model  man;  he  does \nnot  go  in  advance  of  any  one,  nor  after  either;  he  places \nhimself  generally  too  far  off  to  have  any  reason  for  espousing \nthe  cause  of  either  good  or  evil.     If  he  has  been  so  long \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  127 \nconfounded  with  the  philosopher,  with  the  Caesarian  trainer \nand  dictator  of  civilisation,  he  has  had  far  too  much  honour, \nand  what  is  more  essential  in  him  has  been  overlooked — ^he \nis  an  instrument,  something  of  a  slave,  though  certainly  the \nsublimest  sort  of  slave,  but  nothing  in  himself — presque  rien! \nThe  objective  man  is  an  instrument,  a  costly,  easily  injured, \neasily  tarnished,  measuring  instrument  and  mirroring  appara- \n\n\ntus, which  is  to  be  taken  care  of  and  respected;  but  he  is \nno  goal,  no  outgoing  nor  upgoing,  no  complementary  man \nin  whom  the  rest  of  existence  justifies  itself,  no  termination \n— and  still  less  a  commencement,  an  engendering,  or  pri- \nmary cause,  nothing  hardy,  powerful,  self-centred,  that  wants \nto  be  master;  but  rather  only  a  soft,  inflated,  delicate,  mov- \nable potter's-form,  that  must  wait  for  some  kind  of  content \nand  frame  to  \"shape\"  itself  thereto — for  the  most  part  a \nman  without  frame  and  content,  a  \"selfless\"  man.

With \nhis  repudiation  of  scepticism,  it  seems  to  them  as  if  they \nheard  some  evil-threatening  sound  in  the  distance,  as  if  a \nnew  kind  of  explosive  were  being  tried  somewhere,  a  d)ma- \nmite  of  the  spirit,  perhaps  a  newly  discovered  Russian \nnihiline,  a  pessimism  bonae  voluntatis,  that  not  only  denies, \nmeans    denial,    but — dreadful    thought!    practises    denial. \n128  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nAgainst  this  kind  of  \"good  will\" — a  will  to  the  veritable, \nactual  negation  of  life — there  is,  as  is  generally  acknowledged \nnowadays,  no  better  soporific  and  sedative  than  scepticism, \nthe  mild,  pleasing,  lulling  poppy  of  scepticism;  and  Hamlet \nhimself  is  now  prescribed  by  the  doctors  of  the  day  as  an \nantidote  to  the  \"spirit,\"  and  its  underground  noises.  \"Are \nnot  our  ears  already  full  of  bad  sounds?\"  say  the  sceptics,  as \nlovers  of  repose,  and  almost  as  a  kind  of  safety  police,  \"this \nsubterranean  Nay  is  terrible!  Be  still,  ye  pessimistic  moles! \" \nThe  sceptic,  in  effect,  that  delicate  creature,  is  far  too  easily \nfrightened;  his  conscience  is  schooled  so  as  to  start  at  every \nNay,  and  even  at  that  sharp,  decided  Yea,  and  feels  some- \nthing like  a  bite  thereby.  Yea!  and  Nay! — they  seem  to \nhim  opposed  to  morality;  he  loves,  on  the  contrary,  to  make \na  festival  to  his  virtue  by  a  noble  aloofness,  while  perhaps \nhe  says  with  Montaigne:  \"What  do  I  know?\"  Or  with \nSocrates:  \"I  know  that  I  know  nothing.\"  Or:  \"Here  I  do \nnot  trust  myself,  no  door  is  open  to  me.\"  Or:  \"Even  if  the \n\n\ndoor  were  open,  why  should  I  enter  immediately?\"  Or: \n\"What  is  the  use  of  any  hasty  hypotheses?  It  might  quite \nwell  be  in  good  taste  to  make  no  hypotheses  at  all.  Are  you \nabsolutely  obliged  to  straighten  at  once  what  is  crooked?  to \nstuff  every  hole  with  some  kind  of  oakum?  Is  there  not \ntime  enough  for  that?  Has  not  the  time  leisure?  Oh,  ye \ndemons,  can  ye  not  at  all  wait?  The  uncertain  also  has \nits  charms,  the  Sphinx,  too,  is  a  Circe,  and  Circe,  too,  was \na  philosopher.\" — Thus  does  a  sceptic  console  himself;  and  in \ntruth  he  needs  some  consolation.  For  scepticism  is  the  most \nspiritual  expression  of  a  certain  many-sided  physiological \ntemperament,  which  in  ordinary  language  is  called  nervous \ndebility  and  sickliness;  it  arises  whenever  races  or  classes \nwhich  have  been  long  separated,  decisively  and  suddenly \nblend  with  one  another.    In  the  new  generation,  which  has \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  129 \ninherited  as  it  were  different  standards  and  valuations  in  its \nblood,  everything  is  disquiet,  derangement,  doubt,  and  tenta- \ntive; the  best  powers  operate  restrictively,  the  very  virtues \nprevent  each  other  growing  and  becoming  strong,  equilibrium, \nballast,  and  perpendicular  stability  are  lacking  in  body  and \nsoul.  That,  however,  which  is  most  diseased  and  degenerated \nin  such  nondescripts  is  the  will;  they  are  no  longer  familiar \nwith  independence  of  decision,  or  the  courageous  feeling  of \npleasure  in  willing — they  are  doubtful  of  the  \"freedom  of  the \nwill\"  even  in  their  dreams.  Our  present-day  Europe,  the \nscene  of  a  senseless,  precipitate  attempt  at  a  radical  blending \nof  classes,  and  consequently  of  races,  is  therefore  sceptical \nin  all  its  heights  and  depths,  sometimes  exhibiting  the  mobile \nscepticism  which  springs  impatiently  and  wantonly  from \nbranch  to  branch,  sometimes  with  gloomy  aspect,  like  a \ncloud  overcharged  with  interrogative  signs — and  often  sick \nxmto  death  of  its  will!  Paralysis  of  will;  where  do  we  not \nfind  this  cripple  sitting  nowadays!  And  yet  how  bedecked \noftentimes!  How  seductively  ornamented!  There  are  the \nfinest  gala  dresses  and  disguises  for  this  disease;  and  that, \nfor  instance,  most  of  what  places  itself  nowadays  in  the \nshow-cases  as  \"objectiveness,\"  \"the  scientific  spirit,\"  \"I'art \npour  I'art,\"  and  \"pure  voluntary  knowledge,\"  is  only  decked- \nout  scepticism  and  paralysis  of  will — I  am  ready  to  answer \nfor  this  diagnosis  of  the  European  disease.— The  disease  of \nthe  will  is  diffused  unequally  over  Europe;  it  is  worst  and \nmost  varied  where  civilisation  has  longest  prevailed;  it \ndecreases  according  as  \"the  barbarian\"  still — or  again — as- \nserts his  claims  under  the  loose  drapery  of  Western  culture. \nIt  is  therefore  in  the  France  of  to-day,  as  can  be  readily  dis- \nclosed and  comprehended,  that  the  will  is  most  infirm;  and \n\n\nFrance,  which  has  always  had  a  masterly  aptitude  for  con \nverting  even  the  portentous  crises  of  its  spirit  into  something \n130  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \ncharming  and  seductive,  now  manifests  emphatically  its  in- \ntellectual ascendency  over  Europe,  by  being  the  school  and \nexhibition  of  all  the  charms  of  scepticism.  The  power  to \nwill  and  to  persist,  moreover,  in  a  resolution,  is  already \nsomewhat  stronger  in  Germany,  and  again  in  the  North  of \nGermany  it  is  stronger  than  in  Central  Germany;  it  is \nconsiderably  stronger  in  England,  Spain,  and  Corsica,  asso- \nciated with  phlegm  in  the  former  and  with  hard  skulls  in  the \nlatter — not  to  mention  Italy,  which  is  too  young  yet  to \nknow  what  it  wants,  and  must  first  show  whether  it  can \nexercise  will;  but  it  is  strongest  and  most  surprising  of  all \nin  that  immense  middle  empire  where  Europe  as  it  were  flows \nback  to  Asia — namely,  in  Russia.  There  the  power  to  will \nhas  been  long  stored  up  and  accumulated,  there  the  will — \nuncertain  whether  to  be  negative  or  affirmative — waits  threat- \neningly to  be  discharged  (to  borrow  their  pet  phrase  from \nour  physicists).  Perhaps  not  only  Indian  wars  and  compli- \ncations in  Asia  would  be  necessary  to  free  Europe  from  its \ngreatest  danger,  but  also  internal  subversion,  the  shattering \nof  the  empire  into  small  states,  and  above  all  the  introduction \nof  parliamentary  imbecility,  together  with  the  obligation  of \nevery  one  to  read  his  newspaper  at  breakfast.  I  do  not \nsay  this  as  one  who  desires  it;  in  my  heart  I  should  rather \nprefer  the  contrary — I  mean  such  an  increase  in  the  threaten- \ning attitude  of  Russia,  that  Europe  would  have  to  make  up \nits  mind  to  become  equally  threatening — namely,  to  acquire \none  will,  by  means  of  a  new  caste  to  rule  over  the  Continent, \na  persistent,  dreadful  will  of  its  own,  that  can  set  its  aims \nthousands  of  years  ahead ;  so  that  the  long  spun-out  comedy \nof  its  petty-stateism,  and  its  dynastic  as  well  as  its  demo- \ncratic many-willed-ness,  might  finally  be  brought  to  a  close. \nThe  time  for  petty  politics  is  past;  the  next  century \nbring  the  struggle  for  the  dominion  of  the  world — the  cot \nPulsion  to  GTeat  noh'tirs. \nwilL. \nomM, \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  131"

That \nunscrupulous  enthusiast  for  big,  handsome  grenadiers  (who, \nas  King  of  Prussia,  brought  into  being  a  military  and  sceptical \ngenius — and  therewith,  in  reality,  the  new  and  now  triumph- \nantly emerged  type  of  German),  the  problematic,  crazy \nfather  of  Frederick  the  Great,  had  on  one  point  the  very \nknack  and  lucky  grasp  of  the  genius:  he  knew  what  was \nthen  lacking  in  Germany,  the  want  of  which  was  a  hundred \ntimes  more  alarming  and  serious  than  any  lack  of  culture  and \nsocial  form — his  ill-will  to  the  young  Frederick  resulted  from \nthe  anxiety  of  a  profound  instinct.  Men  were  lacking;  and \nhe  suspected,  to  his  bitterest  regret,  that  his  own  son  was \nnot  man  enough.  There,  however,  he  deceived  himself; \nbut  who  would  not  have  deceived  himself  in  his  place? \nHe  saw  his  son  lapsed  to  atheism,  to  the  esprit,  to  the  pleasant \nfrivolity  of  clever  Frenchmen — ^he  saw  in  the  background \nthe  great  bloodsucker,  the  spider  scepticism;  he  suspected  the \nincurable  wretchedness  of  a  heart  no  longer  hard  enough \neither  for  evil  or  good,  and  of  a  broken  will  that  no  longer \ncommands,  is  no  longer  able  to  command.  Meanwhile, \nhowever,  there  grew  up  in  his  son  that  new  kind  of  harder \nand  more  dangerous  scepticism — who  knows  to  what  extent \nit  was  encouraged  just  by  his  father's  hatred  and  the  icy \nmelancholy  of  a  will  condemned  to  solitude? — the  scepticism \nof  daring  manliness,  which  is  closely  related  to  the  genius \nfor  war  and  conquest,  and  made  its  first  entrance  into  Ger- \n132  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nmany  in  the  person  of  the  great  Frederick.  This  scepticism \ndespises  and  nevertheless  grasps;  it  undermines  and  takes \npossession;  it  does  not  beheve,  but  it  does  not  thereby  lose \nitself;  it  gives  the  spirit  a  dangerous  liberty,  but  it  keeps \nstrict  guard  over  the  heart.  It  is  the  German  form  of  scep- \nticism, which,  as  a  continued  Fredericianism,  risen  to  the \nhighest  spirituality,  has  kept  Europe  for  a  considerable  time \nunder  the  dominion  of  the  German  spirit  and  its  critical  and \nhistorical  distrust.  Owing  to  the  insuperably  strong  and \ntough  masculine  character  of  the  great  German  philologists \nand  historical  critics  (who,  rightly  estimated,  were  also  all \nof  them  artists  of  destruction  and  dissolution),  a  new  con- \nception of  the  German  spirit  gradually  established  itself — in \nspite  of  all  Romanticism  in  music  and  philosophy — in  which \nthe  leaning  towards  masculine  scepticism  was  decidedly \n\n\nprominent:  whether,  for  instance,  as  fearlessness  of  gaze, \nas  courage  and  sternness  of  the  dissecting  hand,  or  as  resolute \nwill  to  dangerous  voyages  of  discovery,  to  spiritualised \nNorth  Pole  expeditions  under  barren  and  dangerous  skies. \nThere  may  be  good  groimds  for  it  when  warm-blooded  and \nsuperficial  humanitarians  cross  themselves  before  this  spirit, \ncet  esprit  jataliste,  ironique,  mephistophelique,  as  Michelet \ncalls  it,  not  without  a  shudder.  But  if  one  would  realise \nhow  characteristic  is  this  fear  of  the  \"man\"  in  the  German \nspirit  which  awakened  Europe  out  of  its  \"dogmatic  slumber,\" \nlet  us  call  to  mind  the  former  conception  which  had  to  be \novercome  by  this  new  one — and  that  it  is  not  so  very  long \nago  that  a  masculinised  woman  could  dare,  with  unbridled \npresumption,  to  recommend  the  Germans  to  the  interest  of \nEurope  as  gentle,  good-hearted,  weak-willed,  and  poetical \nfools.  Finally,  let  us  only  understand  profoundly  enough \nNapoleon's  astonishment  when  he  saw  Goethe:  it  reveals \nwhat  had  been  regarded  for  centuries  as  the  \"German  spirit.\" \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  133 \n\"Voila  un  homme!\" — that  was  as  much  as  to  say:  \"But  this \nis  a  man!

With  equal  right  they  might  call \nthemselves  critics;  and  assuredly  they  will  be  men  of  experi- \nments. By  the  name  with  which  I  ventured  to  baptize  them, \nI  have  already  expressly  emphasised  their  attempting  and \ntheir  love  of  attempting:  is  this  because,  as  critics  in  body \nand  soul,  they  will  love  to  make  use  of  experiments  in  a \nnew,  and  perhaps  wider  and  more  dangerous  sense?  In \ntheir  passion  for  knowledge,  will  they  have  to  go  further \nin  daring  and  painful  attempts  than  the  sensitive  and  pam- \npered taste  of  a  democratic  century  can  approve  of? — There \nis  no  doubt:  these  coming  ones  will  be  least  able  to  dispense \nwith  the  serious  and  not  imscrupulous  qualities  which  dis- \ntinguish the  critic  from  the  sceptic:  I  mean  the  certainty \nas  to  standards  of  worth,  the  conscious  employment  of  a \nunity  of  method,  the  wary  courage,  the  standing-alone,  and \nthe  capacity  for  self -responsibility;  indeed,  they  will  avow \namong  themselves  a  delight  in  denial  and  dissection,  and \n\n\na  certain  considerate  cruelty,  which  knows  how  to  handle \nthe  knife  surely  and  deftly,  even  when  the  heart  bleeds. \nThey  will  be  sterner  (and  perhaps  not  always  towards  them- \nselves only)  than  humane  people  may  desire,  they  will  not \ndeal  with  the  \"truth\"  in  order  that  it  may  \"please\"  them, \nor  \"elevate\"  and  \"inspire\"  them — they  will  rather  have \nlittle  faith  in  \"truth\"  bringing  with  it  such  revels  for  the \n134  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nfeelings.  They  will  smile,  those  rigourous  spirits,  when  any \none  says  in  their  presence:  \"that  thought  elevates  me,  why \nshould  it  not  be  true?\"  or:  \"that  work  enchants  me,  why \nshould  it  not  be  beautiful?\"  or:  \"that  artist  enlarges  me, \nwhy  should  he  not  be  great?\"  Perhaps  they  will  not  only \nhave  a  smile,  but  a  genuine  disgust  for  all  that  is  thus  rap- \nturous, idealistic,  feminine,  and  hermaphroditic;  and  if  any \none  could  look  into  their  inmost  hearts,  he  would  not  easily \nfind  therein  the  intention  to  reconcile  \"Christian  sentiments\" \nwith  \"antique  taste,\"  or  even  with  \"modem  parliamentar- \nism\" (the  kind  of  reconciliation  necessarily  found  even \namongst  philosophers  in  our  very  uncertain  and  consequently \nvery  conciliatory  century).

But  all  these  are  only  preliminary  conditions \nfor  his  task;  this  task  itself  demands  something  else — it  re- \nquires him  to  create  values.  The  philosophical  workers,  after \nthe  excellent  pattern  of  Kant  and  Hegel,  have  to  fix  and  for- \nmalise some  great  existing  body  of  valuations — that  is  to \nsay,  former  determinations  of  value,  creations  of  value, \nwhich  have  become  prevalent,  and  are  for  a  time  called \n\"truths\" — whether  in  the  domain  of  the  logical,  the  political \n(moral),  or  the  artistic.  It  is  for  these  investigators  to  make \nwhatever  has  happened  and  been  esteemed  hitherto,  con- \nspicuous, conceivable,  intelligible,  and  manageable,  to  shorten \neverythmg  long,  even  \"time\"  itself,  and  to  subjugate  the \nentire  past:  an  immense  and  wonderful  task,  in  the  carrying \nout  of  which  all  refined  pride,  all  tenacious  will,  can  surely \nfind  satisfaction.    The  real  philosophers,  however,  are  com' \n136  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nmanders  and  law-givers;  they  say:  \"Thus  shall  it  be!\" \nThey  determine  first  the  Whither  and  the  Why  of  mankind, \nand  thereby  set  aside  the  previous  labour  of  all  philosophi- \ncal workers,  and  all  subjugators  of  the  past — they  grasp  at \nthe  future  with  a  creative  hand,  and  whatever  is  and  was, \nbecomes  for  them  thereby  a  means,  an  instrument,  and  a \nhammer.

Hitherto  all \nthose  extraordinary  furtherers  of  humanity  whom  one  calls \nphilosophers — ^who  rarely  regarded  themselves  as  lovers  of \nwisdom,  but  rather  as  disagreeable  fools  and  dangerous  in- \nterrogators— ^have  found  their  mission,  their  hard,  involun- \ntary, imperative  mission  (in  the  end  however  the  greatness \nof  their  mission),  in  being  the  bad  conscience  of  their  age. \nIn  putting  the  vivisector's  knife  to  the  breast  of  the  very \nvirtues  of  their  age,  they  have  betrayed  their  own  secret;  it \nhas  been  for  the  sake  of  a  new  greatness  of  man,  a  new  im- \ntrodden  path  to  his  aggrandisement.  They  have  always  dis- \nclosed how  much  hypocrisy,  indolence,  self-indulgence,  and \nself-neglect,  how  much  falsehood  was  concealed  under  the \nmost  venerated  types  of  contemporary  morality,  how  much \nvirtue  was  outlived;  they  have  always  said:     \"We  must  re- \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  137 \nmove  hence  to  where  you  are  least  at  home.\"  In  face  of  a \nworld  of  \"modem  ideas,\"  which  would  like  to  confine  every \none  in  a  comer,  in  a  \"specialty,\"  a  philosopher,  if  there \ncould  be  philosophers  nowadays,  would  be  compelled  to \nplace  the  greatness  of  man,  the  conception  of  \"greatness,\" \nprecisely  in  his  comprehensiveness  and  multifariousness,  in \nhis  all-roundness;  he  would  even  determine  worth  and  rank \naccording  to  the  amount  and  variety  of  that  which  a  man \ncould  bear  and  take  upon  himself,  according  to  the  extent \nto  which  a  man  could  stretch  his  responsibility.  Nowadays \nthe  taste  and  virtue  of  the  age  weaken  and  attenuate  the \nwill;  nothing  is  so  adapted  to  the  spirit  of  the  age  as  weak- \nness of  will:  consequently,  in  the  ideal  of  the  philosopher, \nstrength  of  will,  stemness  and  capacity  for  prolonged  reso- \nlution, must  specially  be  included  in  the  conception  of \n\"greatness\";  with  as  good  a  right  as  the  opposite  doctrine, \nwith  its  ideal  of  a  silly,  renouncing,  humble,  selfless  human- \nity, was  suited  to  an  opposite  age — such  as  the  sixteenth  cen- \ntury, which  suffered  from  its  accumulated  energy  of  will, \nand  from  the  wildest  torrents  and  floods  of  selfishness.  In \nthe  time  of  Socrates,  among  men  only  of  wom-out  instincts, \nold  conservative  Athenians  who  let  themselves  go — \"for  the \nsake  of  happiness,\"  as  they  said;  for  the  sake  of  pleasure,  as \ntheir  conduct  indicated — and  who  had  continually  on  their \nlips  the  old  pompous  words  to  which  they  had  long  forfeited \nthe  right  by  the  life  they  led,  irony  was  perhaps  necessary \nfor  greatness  of  soul,  the  wicked  Socratic  assurance  of  the \nold  physician  and  plebeian,  who  cut  ruthlessly  into  his  own \nflesh,  as  into  the  flesh  and  heart  of  the  \"noble,\"  with  a  look \n\n\nthat  said  plainly  enou^:  \"Do  not  dissemble  before  me! \nhere — we  are  equal!\"  At  present,  on  the  contrary,  when \nthroughout  Europe  the  herding  animal  alone  attains  to  hon- \nours, and  dispenses  honours,  when  \"equality  of  right\"  can \n138  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \ntoo  readily  be  transformed  into  equality  in  wrong:  I  mean  to \nsay  into  general  war  against  everything  rare,  strange,  and \nprivileged,  against  the  higher  man,  the  higher  soul,  the  higher \nduty,  the  higher  responsibility,  the  creative  plenipotence  and \nlordliness — at  present  it  belongs  to  the  conception  of  \"great- \nness\" to  be  noble,  to  wish  to  be  apart,  to  be  capable  of \nbeing  different,  to  stand  alone,  to  have  to  live  by  personal \ninitiative;  and  the  philosopher  will  betray  something  of  his \nown  ideal  when  he  asserts:  \"He  shall  be  the  greatest  who \ncan  be  the  most  solitary,  the  most  concealed,  the  most  di- \nvergent, the  man  beyond  good  and  evil,  the  master  of  his \nvirtues,  and  of  superabundance  of  will;  precisely  this  shall \nbe  called  greatness:  as  diversified  as  can  be  entire,  as  ample \nas  can  be  full.\"  And  to  ask  once  more  the  question:  Is \ngreatness  possible — nowadays?"

The  fact  that  at \npresent  people  all  talk  of  things  of  which  they  cannot  have \nany  experience,  is  true  more  especially  and  unfortunately  cis \nconcerns  the  philosopher  and  philosophical  matters: — the \nvery  few  know  them,  are  permitted  to  know  them,  and  all \npopular  ideas  about  them  are  false.  Thus,  for  instance,  the \ntruly  philosophical  combination  of  a  bold,  exuberant  spirit- \nuality which  runs  at  presto  pace,  and  a  dialectic  rigour  and \nnecessity  which  makes  no  false  step,  is  unknown  to  most \nthinkers  and  scholars  from  their  own  experience,  and  there- \nfore, should  any  one  speak  of  it  in  their  presence,  it  is  in- \ncredible to  them.  They  conceive  of  every  necessity  as  trou- \nblesome, as  a  painful  compulsory  obedience  and  state  of  con- \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  139 \nstraint;  thinking  itself  is  regarded  by  them  as  something \nslow  and  hesitating,  almost  as  a  trouble,  and  often  enough \nas  \"worthy  of  the  sweat  of  the  noble\" — but  not  at  all  as \n\n\nsomething  easy  and  divine,  closely  related  to  dancing  and \nexuberance!  'To  think\"  and  to  take  a  matter  \"seriously,\" \n\"arduously\" — that  is  one  and  the  same  thing  to  them;  such \nonly  has  been  their  \"experience.\" — Artists  have  here  per- \nhaps a  finer  intuition;  they  who  know  only  too  well  that \nprecisely  when  they  no  longer  do  anything  \"arbitrarily,\" \nand  everything  of  necessity,  their  feeling  of  freedom,  of \nsubtlety,  of  power,  of  creatively  fixing,  disposing  and  shap- \ning, reaches  its  climax — in  short,  that  necessity  and  \"free- \ndom of  will\"  are  then  the  same  thing  with  them.  There  is, \nin  fine,  a  gradation  of  rank  in  psychical  states,  to  which \nthe  gradation  of  rank  in  the  problems  corresponds;  and  the \nhighest  problems  repel  ruthlessly  every  one  who  ventures  too \nnear  them,  without  being  predestined  for  their  solution  by \nthe  loftiness  and  power  of  his  spirituality.  Of  what  use  is  it \nfor  nimble,  everyday  intellects,  or  clumsy,  honest  mechanics \nand  empiricists  to  press,  in  their  plebeian  ambition,  close  to \nsuch  problems,  and  as  it  were  into  this  \"holy  of  holies\" — \nas  so  often  happens  nowadays!

Many  generations  must  have  prepared \nthe  way  for  the  coming  of  the  philosopher;  each  of  his  vir- \ntues must  have  been  separately  acquired,  nurtured,  trans- \nmitted, and  embodied;   not  only  the  bold,  easy,  delicate \n140  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \ncourse  and  current  of  his  thoughts,  but  above  all  the  readi- \nness for  great  responsibilities,  the  majesty  of  ruling  glance \nand  contemning  look,  the  feeling  of  separation  from  the \nmultitude  with  their  duties  and  virtues,  the  kindly  patron- \nage and  defence  of  whatever  is  misunderstood  and  calum- \nniated, be  it  God  or  devil,  the  delight  and  practice  of  su- \npreme justice,  the  art  of  commanding,  the  amplitude  of  will, \nthe  lingering  eye  which  rarely  admires,  rarely  looks  up, \nrarely  loves.  .  .  . \n■  ,j^gtd \nCHAPTER    VII \n\n\nOur  ViRiUES"

It  is  desirable  that \nas  few  people  as  possible  should  reflect  upon  morals,  and \nconsequently  it  is  very  desirable  that  morals  should  not \nsome  day  become  interesting!  But  let  us  not  be  afraid! \nThings  still  remain  to-day  as  they  have  always  been:  I  see \nno  one  in  Europe  who  has  (or  discloses)  an  idea  of  the  fact \nthat  philosophising  concerning  morals  might  be  conducted  in \na  dangerous,  captious,  and  ensnaring  manner — that  calamity \nmight  be  involved  therein.  Observe,  for  example,  the  inde- \nfatigable, inevitable  English  utilitarians:  how  ponderously \nand  respectably  they  stalk  on,  stalk  along  (a  Homeric  meta- \nphor expresses  it  better)  in  the  footsteps  of  Bentham,  just \nas  he  had  already  stalked  in  the  footsteps  of  the  respectable \nHelvetius!  (no,  he  was  not  a  dangerous  man,  HelvetiusJ \nce  senateur  Pococurante,  to  use  an  expression  of  Galiani). \nNo  new  thought,  nothing  of  the  nature  of  a  finer  turning  or] \nbetter  expression  of  an  old  thought,  not  even  a  proper  his- \ntory of  what  has  been  previously  thought  on  the  subject:  1 \nan  impossible  literature,  taking  it  all  in  all,  unless  one  knowsj \nhow  to  leaven  it  with  some  mischief.  In  effect,  the  oldj \nEnglish  vice  called  cant,  which  is  moral  Tartuffism,  has  in- \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  I55 \nsinuated  itself  eilso  into  these  moralists  (whom  one  must \ncertainly  read  with  an  eye  to  their  motives  if  one  must \nread  them),  concealed  this  time  under  the  new  form  of  the \nscientific  spirit;  moreover,  there  is  not  absent  from  them  a \nsecret  struggle  with  the  pangs  of  conscience,  from  which  a \nrace  of  former  Puritans  must  naturally  suffer,  in  all  their \nscientific  tinkering  with  morals.  (Is  not  a  moralist  the  op- \nposite of  a  Puritan?  That  is  to  say,  as  a  thinker  who  re- \ngards morality  as  questionable,  as  worthy  of  interrogation, \nin  short,  as  a  problem?  Is  moralising  not — immoral?)  In \nthe  end,  they  all  want  English  morality  to  be  recognised  as \n\n\nauthoritative,  inasmuch  as  mankind,  or  the  \"general  utility,\" \nor  \"the  happiness  of  the  greatest  number,'' — no!  the  happi- \nness of  England,  will  be  best  served  thereby.  They  would \nlike,  by  all  means,  to  convince  themselves  that  the  striving \nafter  English  happiness,  I  mean  after  comfort  and  fashion \n(and  in  the  highest  instance,  a  seat  in  Parliament),  is  at  the \nsame  time  the  true  path  of  virtue;  in  fact,  that  in  so  far  as \nthere  has  been  virtue  in  the  world  hitherto,  it  has  just  con- \nsisted in  such  striving.  Not  one  of  those  ponderous,  con- \nscience-stricken herding-animals  (who  undertake  to  advocate \nthe  cause  of  egoism  as  conducive  to  the  general  welfare) \nwants  to  have  any  knowledge  or  inkling  of  the  facts  that \nthe  \"general  welfare\"  is  no  ideal,  no  goal,  no  notion  that \ncan  be  at  all  grasped,  but  is  only  a  nostrum, — that  what  is \nfair  to  one  may  not  at  all  be  fair  to  another,  that  the  re- \nquirement of  one  morality  for  all  is  really  a  detriment  to \nhigher  men,  in  short,  that  there  is  a  distinction  of  rank  be- \ntween man  and  man,  and  consequently  between  morality \nand  morality.  They  are  an  unassuming  and  fundamentally \nmediocre  species  of  men,  these  utilitarian  Englishmen,  and, \nas  already  remarked,  in  so  far  as  they  are  tedious,  one  can- \nnot think  highly  enough  of  their  utility.

Occasionally  we  find  certain  solutions  of  problems \nwhich  make  strong  beliefs  for  us;  perhaps  they  are  hence- \nforth called  \"convictions.\"  Later  on — one  sees  in  them  only \nfootsteps  to  self-knowledge,  guide-posts  to  the  problem  which \nwe  ourselves  are — or  more  correctly  to  the  great  stupidity \nwhich  we  embody,  our  spiritual  fate,  the  unteachable  in  us, \nquite  \"down  below.\" — In  view  of  this  liberal  compliment \nwhich  I  have  just  paid  myself,  permission  will  perhaps  be \nmore  readily  allowed  me  to  utter  some  truths  about  \"woman \nas  she  is,\"  provided  that  it  is  known  at  the  outset  how  liter- \nally they  are  merely — my  truths."

For  what  must  these  clumsy  attempts  of  feminine \n:ientificality  and  self -exposure  bring  to  light!     Woman  has \nmuch  cause  for  shame;  in  woman  there  is  so  much  pe- \nmtry,  superficiality,  schoolmasterliness,  petty  presumption, \n1 62  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nunbridledness,  and  indiscretion  concealed — study  only  wom- \nan's behaviour  towards  children! — which  has  really  been \nbest  restrained  and  dominated  hitherto  by  the  fear  of  man. \nAlas,  if  ever  the  \"eternally  tedious  in  woman\" — she  has \nplenty  of  it! — is  allowed  to  venture  forth!  if  she  begins \nradically  and  on  principle  to  unlearn  her  wisdom  and  art — \nof  charming,  of  playing,  of  frightening  away  sorrow,  of  alle- \nviating and  taking  easily;  if  she  forgets  her  delicate  aptitude \nfor  agreeable  desires!  Female  voices  are  already  raised, \nwhich,  by  Saint  Aristophanes!  make  one  afraid: — with  medi- \ncal explicitness  it  is  stated  in  a  threatening  manner  what \nwoman  first  and  last  requires  from  man.  Is  it  not  in  the \nvery  worst  taste  that  woman  thus  sets  herself  up  to  be  scien- \ntific? Enlightenment  hitherto  has  fortunately  been  men's \naffair,  men's  gift — we  remained  therewith  \"among  ourselves\"; \nand  in  the  end,  in  view  of  all  that  women  write  about \n\"woman,\"  we  may  well  have  considerable  doubt  as  to  whether \nwoman  really  desires  enlightenment  about  herself — and  can \ndesire  it.  If  woman  does  not  thereby  seek  a  new  ornament \nfor  herself — I  believe  ornamentation  belongs  to  the  eternally \nfeminine? — why,  then,  she  wishes  to  make  herself  feared: \nperhaps  she  thereby  wishes  to  get  the  mastery.  But  she  does \nnot  want  truth — what  does  woman  care  for  truth?  From \nthe  very  first  nothing  is  more  foreign,  more  repugnant,  or \nmore  hostile  to  woman  than  truth — her  great  art  is  false- \nhood, her  chief  concern  is  appearance  and  beauty.  Let  us \nconfess  it,  we  men:  we  honour  and  love  this  very  art  and \nthis  very  instinct  in  woman:  we  who  have  the  hard  task, \nand  for  our  recreation  gladly  seek  the  company  of  beings \nunder  whose  hands,  glances,  and  delicate  follies,  our  seri- \nousness, our  gravity,  and  profundity  appear  almost  like  fol \nlies  to  us.  Finally,  I  ask  the  question:  Did  a  woman  her \n?e]f  ever  acknowledge  profundity  in  a  woman's  mind,  oi \ni \n\n\nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  163 \njustice  in  a  woman's  heart?  And  is  it  not  true  that  on  the \nwhole  ''woman\"  has  hitherto  been  most  despised  by  woman \nherself,  and  not  at  all  by  us? — We  men  desire  that  woman \nshould  not  continue  to  compromise  herself  by  enlightening \nus;  just  as  it  was  man's  care  and  the  consideration  for \nwoman,  when  the  church  decreed:  mulier  taceat  in  ecclesia. \n[t  was  to  the  benefit  of  woman  when  Napoleon  gave  the  too \neloquent  Madame  de  Stael  to  understand:  mulier  taceat  in \npoliticisf — and  in  my  opinion,  he  is  a  true  friend  of  woman \nwho  calls  out  to  women  to-day:  mulier  taceat  de  mulier e!"

And  let  us  immediately  add  that \n\n\nshe  is  also  losing  taste.  She  is  unlearning  to  jear  man:  but \nthe  woman  who  \"unlearns  to  fear\"  sacrifices  her  most  wom- \nanly instincts.  That  woman  should  venture  forward  when \nthe  fear-inspiring  quality  in  man — or  more  definitely,  thJi \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  167 \nman  in  man — is  no  longer  either  desired  or  fully  developed, \nis  reasonable  enough  and  also  intelligible  enough;  what  is \nmore  difficult  to  understand  is  that  precisely  thereby — ■ \nwoman  deteriorates.  This  is  what  is  happening  nowadays: \nlet  us  not  deceive  ourselves  about  it!  Wherever  the  indus- \ntrial spirit  has  triumphed  over  the  military  and  aristocratic \nspirit,  woman  strives  for  the  economic  and  legal  independ- \nence of  a  clerk:  ''woman  as  clerkess\"  is  inscribed  on  the  por- \ntal of  the  modern  society  which  is  in  course  of  formation. \nWhile  she  thus  appropriates  new  rights,  aspires  to  be  \"mas- \nter,\" and  inscribes  \"progress\"  of  woman  on  her  flags  and \nbanners,  the  very  opposite  realises  itself  with  terrible  ob- \nviousness: woman  retrogrades.  Since  the  French  Revolution \nthe  influence  of  woman  in  Europe  has  declined  in  proportion \nas  she  has  increased  her  rights  and  claims;  and  the  \"emanci- \npation of  woman,\"  in  so  far  as  it  is  desired  and  demanded \nby  women  themselves  (and  not  only  by  masculine  shallow- \npates),  thus  proves  to  be  a  remarkable  symptom  of  the  in- \ncreased weakening  and  deadening  of  the  most  womanly  in- \nstincts. There  is  stupidity  in  this  movement,  an  almost  mas- \nculine stupidity,  of  which  a  well-reared  woman — who  is  al- \nways a  sensible  woman — might  be  heartily  ashamed.  To \nlose  the  intuition  as  to  the  ground  upon  which  she  can  most \nsurely  achieve  victory;  to  neglect  exercise  in  the  use  of  her \nproper  weapons;  to  let-herself-go  before  man,  perhaps  even \n\"to  the  book,\"  where  formerly  she  kept  herself  in  control \nand  in  refined,  artful  humility;  to  neutralise  with  her  vir- \ntuous audacity  man's  faith  in  a  veiled,  fundamentally  differ- \nit  ideal  in  woman,  something  eternally,  necessarily  femi- \nine;  to  emphatically  and  loquaciously  dissuade  man  from \nle  idea  that  woman  must  be  preserved,  cared  for,  pro- \nected,  and  indulged,  like  some  delicate,  strangely  wild,  and \ntften  pleasant  domestic  animal;  the  clumsy  and  indignant \n1 68  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \ncollection  of  everything  of  the  nature  of  servitude  and  bond- \nage which  the  position  of  woman  in  the  hitherto  existing \norder  of  society  has  entailed  and  still  entails  (as  though \nfslavery  were  a  counter-argument,  and  not  rather  a  condition \nof  every  higher  culture,  of  every  elevation  of  culture): — \n\n\nwhat  does  all  this  betoken,  if  not  a  disintegration  of  womanly \ninstincts,  a  de-feminising?  Certainly,  there  are  enough  of \nidiotic  friends  and  corrupters  of  woman  amongst  the  learned \nasses  of  the  masculine  sex,  who  advise  woman  to  de-feminise \nherself  in  this  manner,  and  to  imitate  all  the  stupidities  from \nwhich  \"man\"  in  Europe,  European  \"manliness,\"  suffers, — \nwho  would  like  to  lower  woman  to  \"general  culture,\"  indeed \neven  to  newspaper  reading  and  meddling  with  politics.  Here \nand  there  they  wish  even  to  make  women  into  free  spirits \nand  literary  workers:  as  though  a  woman  without  piety \nwould  not  be  something  perfectly  obnoxious  or  ludicrous  to \na  profound  and  godless  man; — almost  everywhere  her  nerves \nare  being  ruined  by  the  most  morbid  and  dangerous  kind  of \nmusic  (our  latest  German  music),  and  she  is  daily  being \nmade  more  hysterical  and  more  incapable  of  fulfilling  her \nfirst  and  last  function,  that  of  bearing  robust  children.  They \nwish  to  \"cultivate\"  her  in  general  still  more,  and  intend,  as \nthey  say,  to  make  the  \"weaker  sex\"  strong  by  culture:  as \nif  history  did  not  teach  in  the  most  emphatic  manner  that \nthe  \"cultivating\"  of  mankind  and  his  weakening — that  is  to \nsay,  the  weakening,  dissipating,  and  languishing  of  his  force \nof  will — have  always  kept  pace  with  one  another,  and  that \nthe  most  powerful  and  influential  women  in  the  world  (and \nlastly,  the  mother  of  Napoleon)  had  just  to  thank  their \nforce  of  will — and  not  their  schoolmasters! — for  their  power \nand  ascendency  over  men.  That  which  inspires  respect  in \nwoman,  and  often  enough  fear  also,  is  her  nature,  which  is \nmore  \"natural\"  than  that  of  man,  her  genuine,  camivora- \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  169 \nlike,  cunning  flexibility,  her  tiger-claws  beneath  the  glove, \nher  naivete  in  egoism,  her  untrainableness  and  innate  wild- \nness,  the  incomprehensibleness,  extent  and  deviation  of  her \ndesires  and  virtues.  .  .  .  That  which,  in  spite  of  fear,  ex- \ncites one's  sympathy  for  the  dangerous  and  beautiful  cat, \n\"woman,\"  is  that  she  seems  more  afflicted,  more  vulnerable, \nmore  necessitous  of  love  and  more  condemned  to  disillusion- \nment than  any  other  creature.  Fear  and  sympathy:  it  is \nwith  these  feelings  that  man  has  hitherto  stood  in  the  pres- \nence of  woman,  always  with  one  foot  already  in  tragedy, \nwhich  rends  while  it  delights. — What?  And  all  that  is  now \nto  be  at  an  end?  And  the  disenchantment  of  woman  is  in \nprogress?  The  tediousness  of  woman  is  slowly  evolving? \nOh  Europe!  Europe!

This \nprocess  of  tlie  evolving  European,  which  can  be  retarded  in \nits  tempo  by  great  relapses,  but  will  perhaps  just  gain  and \ngrow  thereby  in  vehemence  and  depth — the  still  raging \nstorm  and  stress  of  \"national  sentiment\"  pertains  to  it,  and \nalso  the  anarchism  which  is  appearing  at  present — this \nprocess  will  probably  arrive  at  results  on  which  its  naive \npropagators  and  panegyrists,  the  apostles  of  \"modern  ideas,\" \nwould  least  care  to  reckon.  The  same  new  conditions  under \nwhich  on  an  average  a  levelling  and  mediocrising  of  man \nwill  take  place — a  useful,  industrious,  variously  serviceable \nand  clever  gregarious  man — are  in  the  highest  degree  suitable \nto  give  rise  to  exceptional  men  of  the  most  dangerous  and \nattractive  qualities.

A \nGerman  who  would  embolden  himself  to  assert:  \"Two  souls, \nalas,  dwell  in  my  breast,\"  would  make  a  bad  guess  at  the \ntruth,  or,  more  correctly,  he  would  come  far  short  of  the \ntruth  about  the  number  of  souls.  As  a  people  made  up  of \nthe  most  extraordinary  mixing  and  mingling  of  races,  per- \nhaps even  with  a  preponderance  of  the  pre-Aryan  element, \nas  the  \"people  of  the  centre\"  in  every  sense  of  the  term, \nthe  Germans  are  more  intangible,  more  ample,  more  con- \nadictory,   more  unknown,   more  incalculable,  more  sur- \nI \n176  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nprising,  and  even  more  terrifying  than  other  peoples  are  to \nthemselves: — they  escape  definition,  and  are  thereby  alone \nthe  despair  of  the  French.  It  is  characteristic  of  the  Ger- \nmaas  that  the  question:  \"What  is  German?\"  never  dies \nout  among  them.  Kotzebue  certainly  knew  his  Germans \nwell  enough:  \"we  are  known,\"  they  cried  jubilantly  to  him — \nbut  Sand  also  thought  he  knew  them.  Jean  Paul  knew \nwhat  he  was  doing  when  he  declared  himself  incensed  at \nFichte's  lying  but  patriotic  flatteries  and  exaggerations, — \nbut  it  is  probable  that  Goethe  thought  differently  about  Ger- \nmans from  Jean  Paul,  even  though  he  acknowledged  him  to \nbe  right  with  regard  to  Fichte.  It  is  a  question  what  Goethe \n\n\nreally  thought  about  the  Germans? — But  about  many  things \naround  him  he  never  spoke  explicitly,  and  all  his  life  he \nknew  how  to  keep  an  astute  silence — probably  he  had  good \nreason  for  it.  It  is  certain  that  it  was  not  the  \"Wars  of  In- \ndependence\" that  made  him  look  up  more  joyfully,  any \nmore  than  it  was  the  French  Revolution, — the  event  on \naccount  of  which  he  reconstructed  his  \"Faust,\"  and  indeed \nthe  whole  problem  of  \"man,\"  was  the  appearance  of  Na- \npoleon. There  are  words  of  Goethe  in  which  he  condemns \nwith  impatient  severity,  as  from  a  foreign  land,  that  which \nGermans  take  a  pride  in:  he  once  defined  the  famous  German \nturn  of  mind  as  \"Indulgence  towards  its  own  and  others' \nweaknesses.\"  Was  he  wrong?  it  is  characteristic  of  Germans \nthat  one  is  seldom  entirely  wrong  about  them.  The  German \nsoul  has  passages  and  galleries  in  it,  there  are  caves,  hiding- \nplaces,  and  dungeons  thereir.;  its  disorder  has  much  of  the \ncharm  of  the  mysterious;  the  German  is  well  acquainted \nwith  the  by-paths  to  chaos.  And  as  everything  loves  its \nsymbol,  so  the  German  loves  the  clouds  and  all  that  is  ob- \nscure, evolving,  crepuscular,  damp,  and  shrouded:  it  seems \nto  him  that  everything  uncertain,  undeveloped,  self-displac- \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  177 \ning,  and  growing  is  \"deep.\"  The  German  himself  does  not \nexist:  he  is  becoming,  he  is  \"developing  himself.\"  \"Develop- \nment\" is  therefore  the  essentially  German  discovery  and  hit \nin  the  great  domain  of  philosophical  formulas, — a  ruling \nidea,  which,  together  with  German  beer  and  German  music, \nis  labouring  to  Germanise  all  Europe.  Foreigners  are  as- \ntonished and  attracted  by  the  riddles  which  the  conflicting \nnature  at  the  basis  of  the  German  soul  propounds  to  them \n(riddles  which  Hegel  systematised  and  Richard  Wagner  has \nin  the  end  set  to  music).  \"Good-natured  and  spiteful\" — \nsuch  a  juxtaposition,  preposterous  in  the  case  of  every  other \npeople,  is  unfortunately  only  too  often  justified  in  Germany: \none  has  only  to  live  for  a  while  among  Swabians  to  know \nthis!  The  clumsiness  of  the  German  scholar  and  his  soci£il \ndistastefulness  agree  alarmingly  well  with  his  physical  rope- \ndancing  and  nimble  boldness,  of  which  all  the  Gods  have \nlearnt  to  be  afraid.  If  any  one  wishes  to  see  the  \"German \nsoul\"  demonstrated  ad  oculos,  let  him  only  look  at  German \ntaste,  at  German  arts  and  manners:  what  boorish  indifference \nto  \"taste\"!  How  the  noblest  and  the  commonest  stand \nthere  in  juxtaposition!  How  disorderly  and  how  rich  is  the \nwhole  constitution  of  this  soul!  The  German  drags  at  his \nsoul,  he  drags  at  everything  he  experiences.  He  digests  his \nevents  badly;  he  never  gets  \"done\"  with  them;  and  German \ndepth  is  often  only  a  difficult,  hesitating  \"digestion.\"  And \n\n\njust  as  all  chronic  invalids,  all  dyspeptics,  like  what  is  con- \nvenient, so  the  German  loves  \"fr^ikness\"  and  \"honesty\"; \nit  is  so  convenient  to  be  frank  and  honest! — This  confiding- \nness,  this  complaisance,  this  showing-the-cards  of  German \nhonesty,  is  probably  the  most  dangerous  and  most  successful \ndisguise  which  the  German  is  up  to  nowadays:  it  is  his  proper \nMephistophelean  art;  with  this  he  can  \"still  achieve  much\"! \nriBie  German  lets  himself  go,  and  thereby  gazes  with  faithful, \n178  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nblue,  empty  German  eyes — and  other  coimtries  immediately \nconfound  him  with  his  dressing-gown! — I  meant  to  say \nthat,  let  \"German  depth\"  be  what  it  will — among  ourselves \nalone  we  perhaps  take  the  liberty  to  laugh  at  it — we  shall  do \nwell  to  continue  henceforth  to  honour  its  appearance  and \ngood  name,  and  not  barter  away  too  cheaply  our  old  reputa- \ntion as  a  people  of  depth  for  Prussian  \"smartness,\"  and \nBerlin  wit  and  sand.  It  is  wise  for  a  people  to  pose,  and  let \nitself  be  regarded,  as  profound,  clumsy,  good-natured,  honest, \nand  foolish:  it  might  even  be — profound  to  do  so!  Finally, \nwe  should  do  honour  to  our  name — we  are  not  called  the \n\"tiusche  Volk\"  (deceptive  people)  for  nothing.  .  .  ."

Ah,  some  time  or  other  it  will  be  over  with  it! — \nbut  who  can  doubt  that  it  will  be  over  still  sooner  with  the \nintelligence  and  taste  for  Beethoven!  For  he  was  only  the \nlast  echo  of  a  break  and  transition  in  style,  and  not,  like \nMozart,  the  last  echo  of  a  great  European  taste  which  had \nexisted  for  centuries.  Beethoven  is  the  intermediate  event \nbetween  an  old  mellow  soul  that  is  constantly  breaking  down, \nand  a  future  over-young  soul  that  is  always  coming;  there  is \nspread  over  his  music  the  twilight  of  eternal  loss  and  eternal \nextravagant  hope, — the  same  light  in  which  Europe  was \nbathed  when  it  dreamed  with  Rousseau,  when  it  danced \nround  the  Tree  of  Liberty  of  the  Revolution,  and  finaOfll \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  179 \nalmost  fell  down  in  adoration  before  Napoleon.  But  how \n\n\nrapidly  does  this  very  sentiment  now  pale,  how  difficult \nnowadays  is  even  the  apprehension  of  this  sentiment,  how \nstrangely  does  the  language  of  Rousseau,  Schiller,  Shelley, \nand  Byron  sound  to  our  ear,  in  whom  collectively  the  same \nfate  of  Europe  was  able  to  speak,  which  knew  how  to  sing \nin  Beethoven! — Whatever  German  music  came  afterwards, \nbelongs  to  Romanticism,  that  is  to  say,  to  a  movement \nwhich,  historically  considered,  was  still  shorter,  more  fleeting, \nand  more  superficial  than  that  great  interlude,  the  transition \nof  Europe  from  Rousseau  to  Napoleon,  and  to  the  rise  of \ndemocracy.  Weber — ^but  what  do  we  care  nowadays  for \n\"Freischutz\"  and  \"Oberon\"!  Or  Marschner's  \"Hans  Hell- \ning\" and  \"Vampyre\"!  Or  even  Wagner's  \"Tarmhauser\" ! \nThat  is  extinct,  although  not  yet  forgotten  music.  This  whole \nmusic  of  Romanticism,  besides,  was  not  noble  enough,  was \nnot  musical  enough,  to  maintain  its  position  anywhere  but \nin  the  theatre  and  before  the  masses;  from  the  beginning  it \nwas  second-rate  music,  which  was  little  thought  of  by  gen- \nuine musicians.  It  was  different  with  Felix  Mendelssohn, \nthat  halcyon  master,  who,  on  account  of  his  lighter,  purer, \nhappier  soul,  quickly  acquired  admiration,  and  was  equally \nquickly  forgotten:  as  the  beautiful  episode  of  German  music. \nBut  with  regard  to  Robert  Schumann,  who  took  things  se- \nriously, and  has  been  taken  seriously  from  the  first— he \nwas  the  last  that  founded  a  school, — do  we  not  now  regard \nit  as  a  satisfaction,  a  relief,  a  deliverance,  that  this  very \nRomanticism  of  Schumann's  has  been  surmounted?  Schu- \nmann, fleeing  into  the  \"Saxon  Switzerland\"  of  his  soul,  with \na  half  Werther-like,  half  Jean-Paul-like  nature  (assuredly \nnot  like  Beethoven!  assuredly  not  like  Byron!) — ^his  Man- \nfred music  is  a  mistake  and  a  misunderstanding  to  the  extent \nof  injustice;  Schumann,  with  his  taste,  which  was  funda- \ni8o  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nmaitally  a  petty  taste  (that  is  to  say,  a  dangerous  propensity \n— doubly  dangerous  among  Germans — for  quiet  lyricism  and \nintoxication  of  the  feelings),  going  constantly  apart,  timidly \nwithdrawing  and  retiring,  a  noble  weakling  who  revelled  in \nnothing  but  zmonymous  joy  and  sorrow,  from  the  begirming \na  sort  of  girl  and  noli  me  tangere — this  Schumann  was  al- \nready merely  a  German  event  in  music,  and  no  longer  a \nEuropean  event,  as  Beethoven  had  been,  as  in  a  still  greater \ndegree  Mozart  had  been ;  with  Schumann  German  music  was \nthreatened  with  its  greatest  danger,  that  of  losing  the  voice \nfor  the  soul  of  Europe  and  sinking  into  a  merely  national \naffair."

The  German  does  not \nread  aloud,  he  does  not  read  for  the  ear,  but  only  with  his \neyes;  he  has  put  his  ears  away  in  the  drawer  for  the  time. \nIn  antiquity  when  a  man  read — which  was  seldom  enough — \nhe  read  something  to  himself,  and  in  a  loud  voice;  they  were \nsurprised  when  any  one  read  silently,  and  sought  secretly \nthe  reason  of  it.  In  a  loud  voice:  that  is  to  say,  with  all \nthe  swellings,  inflections,  and  variations  of  key  and  changes \nof  tempo,  in  which  the  ancient  public  world  took  delight. \n\n\nThe  laws  of  the  written  style  were  then  the  same  as  those \nof  the  spoken  style;  and  these  laws  depended  partly  on  the \nsurprising  development  and  refined  requirements  of  the  ear \nand  larynx;  partly  on  the  strength,  endurance,  and  power \nof  the  ancient  lungs.  In  the  ancient  sense,  a  period  is  above \nall  a  physiological  whole,  inasmuch  as  it  is  comprised  in  one \nt82  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nbreath.  Such  periods  as  occur  in  Demosthenes  and  Cicero, \nswelling  twice  and  sinking  twice,  and  all  in  one  breath, \nwere  pleasures  to  the  men  of  antiquity,  who  knew  by  their \nown  schooling  how  to  appreciate  the  virtue  therein,  the \nrareness  and  the  difficulty  in  the  deliverance  of  such  a  pe- \nriod; — we  have  really  no  right  to  the  big  period,  we  modem \nmen,  who  are  short  of  breath  in  every  sense!  Those  ancients, \nindeed,  were  all  of  them  dilettanti  in  speaking,  consequently \nconnoisseurs,  consequently  critics — they  thus  brought  their \norators  to  the  highest  pitch;  in  the  same  maimer  as  in  the \nlast  century,  when  all  Italian  ladies  and  gentlemen  knew \nhow  to  sing,  the  virtuosoship  of  song  (and  with  it  also  the \nart  of  melody)  reached  its  elevation.  In  Germany,  how- \never (until  quite  recently  when  a  kind  of  platform  eloquence \nbegan  shyly  and  awkwardly  enough  to  flutter  its  young \nwings),  there  was  properly  speaking  only  one  kind  of  public \nand  approximately  artistical  discourse — that  delivered  from \nthe  pulpit.  The  preacher  was  the  only  one  in  Germany  who \nknew  the  weight  of  a  syllable  or  a  word,  in  what  manner \na  sentence  strikes,  springs,  rushes,  flows,  and  comes  to  a \nclose;  he  alone  had  a  conscience  in  his  ears,  often  enough \na  bad  conscience:  for  reasons  are  not  lacking  why  pro- \nficiency in  oratory  should  be  especially  seldom  attained  by \na  German,  or  almost  always  too  late.  The  masterpiece  of \nGerman  prose  is  therefore  with  good  reason  the  masterpiece \nof  its  greatest  preacher:  the  Bible  has  hitherto  been  the \nbest  German  book.  Compared  with  Luther's  Bible,  almost \neverything  else  is  merely  \"literature\" — something  which  has \nnot  grown  in  Germany,  and  therefore  has  not  taken  and  does \nnot  take  root  in  German  hearts,  as  the  Bible  has  done. \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  183"

For \nthis,  we  artists  among  the  spectators  and  philosophers,  are — \ngrateful  to  the  Jews. \n2SI \nIt  must  be  taken  into  the  bargain,  if  various  clouds  and \ndisturbances — in  short,  slight  attacks  of  stupidity — pass  over \nthe  spirit  of  a  people  that  suffers  and  wants  to  suffer  from \nnational  nervous  fever  and  political  ambition:  for  instance, \namong  present-day  Germans  there  is  alternately  the  anti- \nFrench  folly,  the  anti-Semitic  folly,  the  anti-Polish  folly,  the \nChristian-romantic  folly,  the  Wagnerian  folly,  the  Teutonic \n\n\nfolly,  the  Prussian  folly  (just  look  at  those  poor  historians, \nthe  Sybels  and  Treitschkes,  and  their  closely  bandaged \nheads),  and  whatever  else  these  little  obscurations  of  the \nGerman  spirit  and  conscience  may  be  called.  May  it  be  for- \ngiven me  that  I,  too,  when  on  a  short  daring  sojourn  on  very \ninfected  ground,  did  not  remain  wholly  exempt  from  the  dis- \nease, but  like  every  one  else,  began  to  entertain  thoughts \nabout  matters  which  did  not  concern  me — the  first  symptom \nof  political  infection.  About  the  Jews,  for  instance,  listen \nto  the  following: — I  have  never  yet  met  a  German  who  was \nfavourably  inclined  to  the  Jews;  and  however  decided  the \nrepudiation  of  actual  anti-Semitism  may  be  on  the  part  of \nall  prudent  and  political  men,  this  prudence  and  policy  is  not \nperhaps  directed  against  the  nature  of  the  sentiment  itself, \nbut  only  against  its  dangerous  excess,  and  especially  against \nBEYOND   GOOD  AND  EVIL  185 \nthe  distasteful  and  infamous  expression  of  this  excess  of \nsentiment; — on  this  point  we  must  not  deceive  ourselves. \nThat  Germany  has  amply  sufficient  Jews,  that  the  German \nstomach,  the  German  blood,  has  difficulty  (and  will  long \nhave  difficulty)  in  disposing  only  of  this  quantity  of  \"Jew\" \n— as  the  Italian,  the  Frenchman,  and  the  Englishman  have \ndone  by  means  of  a  stronger  digestion: — that  is  the  im- \nmistakable  declaration  and  language  of  a  general  instinct, \nto  which  one  must  listen  and  according  to  which  one  must \nact.  \"Let  no  more  Jews  come  in!  And  shut  the  doors, \nespecially  towards  the  East  (also  towards  Austria) ! \" — thus \ncommands  the  instinct  of  a  people  whose  nature  is  still \nfeeble  and  uncertain,  so  that  ii  could  be  easily  wiped  out, \neasily  extinguished,  by  a  stronger  race.  The  Jews,  however, \nare  beyond  all  doubt  the  strongest,  toughest,  and  purest  race \nat  present  living  in  Europe;  they  know  how  to  succeed  even \nunder  the  worst  conditions  (in  fact  better  than  under  favour- \nable ones),  by  means  of  virtues  of  some  sort,  which  one \nwould  like  nowadays  to  label  as  vices — owing  above  all  to  a \nresolute  faith  which  does  not  need  to  be  ashamed  before \n\"modem  ideas\";  they  alter  only,  wken  they  do  alter,  in  the \nsame  way  that  the  Russian  Empire  makes  its  conquest — as \nan  empire  that  has  plenty  of  time  and  is  not  of  yesterday — \nnamely,  according  to  the  principle,  \"as  slowly  as  possible\"! \nA  thinker  who  has  the  future  of  Europe  at  heart,  ^vill,  in  all \nhis  perspectives  concerning  the  future,  calculate  upon  the \nJews,  as  he  will  calculate  upon  the  Russians,  as  above  all \nthe  surest  and  likeliest  factors  in  the  great  play  and  battle \nof  forces.  That  which  is  at  present  called  a  \"nation\"  in \nEurope,  and  is  really  rather  a  res  facta  than  nata  (indeed, \nsometimes  confusingly  similar  to  a  res  ficta  et  picta),  is  in \n\n\nevery  case  something  evolving,  young,  easily  displaced,  and \nnot  yet  a  race,  much  less  such  a  race  acre  perennius,  as  the \n1 85  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nJews  are:  such  \"nations\"  should  most  carefully  avoid  all  hot- \nheaded rivalry  and  hostility!  It  is  certain  that  the  Jews, \nif  they  desired — or  if  they  were  driven  to  it,  as  the  anti- \nSemites  seem  to  wish — could  now  have  the  ascendency,  nay, \nliterally  the  supremacy,  over  Europe;  that  they  are  not  work- \ning and  planning  for  that  end  is  equally  certain.  Meanwhile, \nthey  rather  wish  and  desire,  even  somewhat  importunely,  to \nbe  insorbed  and  absorbed  by  Europe;  they  long  to  be  finally \nsettled,  authorised,  and  respected  somewhere,  and  wish  to \nput  an  end  to  the  nomadic  life,  to  the  \"wandering  Jew\"; — \nand  one  should  certainly  take  account  of  this  impulse  and \ntendency,  and  make  advances  to  it  (it  possibly  betokens  a \nmitigation  of  the  Jewish  instincts) :  for  which  purpose  it \nwould  perhaps  be  useful  and  fair  to  banish  the  anti-Semitic \nbawlers  out  of  the  country.  One  should  make  advances \nwith  all  prudence,  and  with  selection;  pretty  much  as  the \nEnglish  nobility  do.  It  stands  to  reason  that  the  more  power- \nful and  strongly  marked  types  of  new  Germanism  could \nenter  into  relation  with  the  Jews  with  the  least  hesitation, \nfor  instance,  the  nobleman  officer  from  the  Prussian  border: \nit  would  be  interesting  in  many  ways  to  see  whether  the \ngenius  for  money  and  patience  (and  especially  some  intellect \nand  intellectuality — sadly  lacking  in  the  place  referred  to) \ncould  not  in  addition  be  annexed  and  trained  to  the  heredi- \ntary art  of  commanding  and  obeying — for  both  of  which  the \ncountry  in  question  has  now  a  classic  reputation.  But  here \nit  is  expedient  to  break  off  my  festal  discourse  and  my \nsprightly  Teutonomania:  for  I  have  already  reached  my \nserious  topic,  the  \"European  problem,\"  as  I  understand  it, \nthe  rearing  of  a  new  ruling  caste  for  Europe. \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  187"

      "text": "They  are  not  a  philosophical  race — the  English :  Bacon \nrepresents  an  attack  on  the  philosophical  spirit  generally, \nHobbes,  Hume,  and  Locke,  an  abasement,  and  a  depreciation \nof  the  idea  of  a  \"philosopher\"  for  more  than  a  century.  It \nwas  against  Hume  that  Kant  uprose  and  raised  himself; \nit  was  Locke  of  whom  Schelling  rightly  said,  \"Je  meprise \nLocke\" ;  in  the  struggle  against  the  English  mechanical  stulti- \n\n\nfication of  the  world,  Hegel  and  Schopenhauer  (along  with \nGoethe)  were  of  one  accord;  the  two  hostile  brother-geniuses \nin  philosophy,  who  pushed  in  different  directions  towards  the \nopposite  poles  of  German  thought,  and  thereby  wronged  each \nother  as  only  brothers  will  do. — What  is  lacking  in  England, \nand  has  always  been  lacking,  that  half-actor  and  rhetorician \nknew  well  enough,  the  absurd  muddle-head,  Carlyle,  who \nsought  to  conceal  under  passionate  grimaces  what  he  knew \nabout  himself:  namely,  what  was  lacking  in  Carlyle — real \npower  of  intellect,  real  depth  of  intellectual  perception,  in \nshort,  philosophy.  It  is  characteristic  of  such  an  unphilo- \nsophical  race  to  hold  on  firmly  to  Christianity — they  need \nits  discipline  for  \"moralising\"  and  humanising.  The  Eng- \nlishman, more  gloomy,  sensual,  headstrong,  and  brutal  than \nthe  German — is  for  that  very  reason,  as  the  baser  of  the \ntwo,  also  the  most  pious:  he  has  all  the  more  need  of \nChristianity.  To  finer  nostrils,  this  English  Christianity  itself \nhas  still  a  characteristic  English  taint  of  spleen  and  alcoholic \nexcess,  for  which,  owing  to  good  reasons,  it  is  used  as  an \nantidote — the  finer  poison  to  neutralise  the  coarser:  a  finer \nform  of  poisoning  is  in  fact  a  step  in  advance  with  coarse- \nmannered  people,  a  step  towards  spiritualisation.  The \nEnglish  coarseness  and  rustic  demureness  is  still  most  satis- \n1 88  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nfactorily  disguised  by  Christian  pantomime,  and  by  prayivig \nand  psalm-singing  (or,  more  correctly,  it  is  thereby  explained \nand  differently  expressed) ;  and  for  the  herd  of  drunkards \nand  rakes  who  formerly  learned  moral  grunting  under  the \ninfluence  of  Methodism  (and  more  recently  as  the  \"Salvation \nArmy\"),  a  penitential  fit  may  really  be  the  relatively  highest \nmanifestation  of  \"humanity\"  to  which  they  can  be  elevated: \nso  much  may  reasonably  be  admitted.  That,  however,  which \noffends  even  in  the  humanest  Englishman  is  his  lack  of  music, \nto  speak  figuratively  (and  also  literally):  he  has  neither \nrhythm  nor  dance  in  the  movements  of  his  soul  and  body; \nindeed,  not  even  the  desire  for  rhythm  and  dance,  for \n\"music.\"  Listen  to  him  speaking;  look  at  the  most  beautiful \nEnglishwoman  walking — in  no  country  on  earth  are  there \nmore  beautiful  doves  and  swans;  finally,  listen  to  them  sing- \ning!   But  I  ask  too  much.  .  .  . \nThere  are  truths  which  are  best  recognised  by  mediocre \nminds,  because  they  are  best  adapted  for  them,  there  are \ntruths  which  only  possess  charms  and  seductive  power  for \nmediocre  spirits: — one  is  pushed  to  this  probably  unpleasant \nconclusion,  now  that  the  influence  of  respectable  but  medio- \ncre Englishmen — I  may  mention  Darwin,  John  Stuart  Mill, \n\n\nand  Herbert  Spencer — begins  to  gain  the  ascendency  in  the \nmiddle-class  region  of  European  taste.  Indeed,  who  could \ndoubt  that  it  is  a  useful  thing  for  such  minds  to  have  the \nascendency  for  a  time?  It  would  be  an  error  to  consider \nthe  highly  developed  and  independently  soaring  minds  as \nspecially  qualified  for  determining  and  collecting  many  little \ncommon  facts,  and  deducing  conclusions  from  them;  as  ex- \nceptioiis,  they  are  rather  from  the  first  in  no  very  favourable \nBEYOND   GOOD  AND  EVIL  i&> \nposition  towards  those  who  are  \"the  rules.\"  After  all,  they \nhave  more  to  do  than  merely  to  perceive: — in  effect,  they \nhave  to  be  something  new,  they  have  to  signify  something \nnew,  they  have  to  represent  new  values!  The  gulf  between \nknowledge  and  capacity  is  perhaps  greater,  and  also  more \nmysterious,  than  one  thinks:  the  capable  man  in  the  grand \nstyle,  the  creator,  will  possibly  have  to  be  an  ignorant  per- \nson;— while  on  the  other  hand,  for  scientific  discoveries  like \nthose  of  Darwin,  a  certain  narrowness,  aridity,  and  indus- \ntrious carefulness  (in  short  something  English)  may  not \nbe  imfavourable  for  arriving  at  them. — Finally,  let  it  not  be \nforgotten  that  the  English,  with  their  profound  mediocrity, \nbrought  about  once  before  a  general  depression  of  European \nintelligence.  What  is  called  \"modern  ideas,\"  or  \"the  ideas  of \nthe  eighteenth  century,\"  or  \"French  ideas\" — that,  conse- \nquently, against  which  the  German  mind  rose  up  with \nprofovmd  disgust — is  of  English  origin,  there  is  no  doubt \nabout  it.  The  French  were  only  the  apes  and  actors  of  these \nideas,  their  best  soldiers,  and  likewise,  alas!  their  first  and \nprofoundest  victims;  for  owing  to  the  diabolical  Anglomania \nof  \"modem  ideas,\"  the  dme  jranqais  has  in  the  end  become \nso  thin  and  emaciated,  that  at  present  one  recalls  its  sixteenth \nand  seventeenth  centuries,  its  profound,  passionate  strength, \nits  inventive  excellency,  almost  with  disbelief.  One  must, \nhowever,  maintain  this  verdict  of  historical  justice  in  a  de- \ntermined manner,  and  defend  it  against  present  prejudices \nand  appearances:  the  European  noblesse — of  sentiment,  taste, \nand  manners,  taking  the  word  in  every  high  sense — is  the \nwork  and  invention  of  France;  the  European  ignobleness, \nthe  plebeianism  of  modem  ideas — is  England's  work  and  in- \nvention. \n190  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL"

They  have  all  something  in \ncommon:  they  keep  their  ears  closed  in  presence  of  the \ndelirious  folly  and  noisy  spouting  of  the  democratic  bour- \ngeois. In  fact,  a  besotted  and  brutalised  France  at  present \nsprawls  in  the  foreground — it  recently  celebrated  a  veritable \norgy  of  bad  taste,  and  at  the  same  time  of  self-admiration, \nat  the  funeral  of  Victor  Hugo.  There  is  also  something  else \ncommon  to  them:  a  predilection  to  resist  intellectual  Ger- \nmanising— and  a  still  greater  inability  to  do  so!  In  this \nFrance  of  intellect,  which  is  also  a  France  of  pessimism, \nSchopenhauer  has  perhaps  become  more  at  home,  and  more \nindigenous  than  he  has  ever  been  in  Germany;  not  to  speak \nof  Heinrich  Heine,  who  has  long  ago  been  re-incarnated  in \nthe  more  refined  and  fastidious  lyrists  of  Paris;  or  of  Hegel, \nwho  at  present,  in  the  form  of  Taine — the  first  of  living  his- \ntorians— exercises  an  almost  tyrannical  influence.  As  re- \ngards Richard  Wagner,  however,  the  more  French  music \nlearns  to  adapt  itself  to  the  actual  needs  of  the  dme  moderne, \nthe  more  will  it  \"Wagnerise\";  one  can  safely  predict  that \nbeforehand, — it  is  already  taking  place  sufficiently!  There \nare,  however,  three  things  which  the  French  can  still  boast \nof  with  pride  as  their  heritage  and  possession,  and  as  indelible \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  191 \ntokens  of  their  ancient  intellectual  superiority  in  Europe,  in \nspite  of  all  voluntary  or  involuntary  Germanising  and  vul-, \ngarising  of  taste.  Firstly,  the  capacity  for  artistic  emotion, \nfor  devotion  to  \"form,\"  for  which  the  expression,  Vart  pour \nI' art,  along  with  numerous  others,  has  been  invented: — such \ncapacity  has  not  been  lacking  in  France  for  three  centuries; \nand  owing  to  its  reverence  for  the  \"small  number,\"  it  has \nagain  and  again  made  a  sort  of  chamber  music  of  literature \npossible,  which  is  sought  for  in  vain  elsewhere  in  Europe. — \nThe  second  thing  whereby  the  French  c£in  lay  claim  to  a \nsuperiority  over  Europe  is  their  ancient,  many-sided,  moral- \nistic culture,  owing  to  which  one  finds  on  an  average,  even \nin  the  petty  romanciers  of  the  newspapers  and  chance  boule- \nvardiers  de  Paris,  a  psychological  sensitiveness  and  curiosity, \nof  which,  for  example,  one  has  no  conception  (to  say  noth- \ning of  the  thing  itself ! )  in  Germany.  The  Germans  lack  a \n\n\ncouple  of  centuries  of  the  moralistic  work  requisite  thereto, \nwhich,  as  we  have  said,  France  has  not  grudged:  those  who \ncall  the  Germans  \"naive\"  on  that  account  give  them  com^ \nmendation  for  a  defect.  (As  the  opposite  of  the  German \ninexperience  and  innocence  in  voluptate  psychologica,  which \nis  not  too  remotely  associated  with  the  tediousness  of  Ger- \nman intercourse, — and  as  the  most  successful  expression  of \ngenuine  French  curiosity  and  inventive  talent  in  this  domain \nof  delicate  thrills,  Henri  Beyle  may  be  noted;  that  remark- \nable anticipatory  and  forerunning  man,  who,  with  a  Na- \npoleonic tempo,  traversed  his  Europe,  in  fact,  several \ncenturies  of  the  European  soul,  as  a  surveyor  and  discoverer \nthereof: — it  has  required  two  generations  to  overtake  him \none  way  or  other,  to  divine  long  afterwards  some  of  the \nriddles  that  perplexed  and  enraptured  him — this  strange \nEpicurean  and  man  of  interrogation,  the  last  great  psycholo- \ngist of  France). — There  is  yet  a  third  claim  to  superiority: \n192  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \n'\"n  the  French  character  there  is  a  successful  half-way  s)^!- \nthesis  of  the  North  and  South,  which  makes  them  compre- \nhend many  things,  and  enjoins  upon  them  other  things, \nwhich  an  Englishman  can  never  comprehend.  Their  tem- \nperament, turned  alternately  to  and  from  the  South,  in \nwhich  from  time  to  time  the  Provencal  and  Ligurian  blood \nfroths  over,  preserves  them  from  the  dreadful,  northern \ngray-in-gray,  from  sunless  conceptual-spectrism  and  from \npoverty  of  blood — our  German  infirmity  of  taste,  for  the \nexcessive  prevalence  of  which  at  the  present  moment,  blood \nand  iron,  that  is  to  say  \"high  politics,\"  has  with  great  reso- \nlution been  prescribed  (according  to  a  dangerous  healing  art, \nwhich  bids  me  wait  and  wait,  but  not  yet  hope). — There  is \nalso  still  in  France  a  pre-understanding  and  ready  welcome \nfor  those  rarer  and  rarely  gratified  men,  who  are  too  com- \nprehensive to  find  satisfaction  in  any  kind  of  fatherlandism, \nand  know  how  to  love  the  South  when  in  the  North  £md  the \nNorth  when  in  the  South — the  bom  Midlanders,  the  \"good \nEuropeans.\"  For  them  Bizet  has  made  music,  this  latest \ngenius,  who  has  seen  a  new  beauty  and  seduction, — who  has \ndiscovered  a  piece  of  the  South  in  music."

Let  the  German  friends  of  Richard  Wag- \nner advise  together  as  to  whether  there  is  anything  purely \nGerman  in  the  Wagnerian  art,  or  whether  its  distinction  dees \nnot  consist  precisely  in  coming  from  super-German  sources \nand  impulses:  in  which  connection  it  may  not  be  underrated \nhow  indispensable  Paris  was  to  the  development  of  his  type, \nwhich  the  strength  of  his  instincts  made  him  long  to  visit  at \nthe  most  decisive  time — and  how  the  whole  style  of  his  pro- \nceedings, of  his  self-apostolate,  could  only  perfect  itself  in \nsight  of  the  French  socialistic  original.  On  a  more  subtle \ncomparison  it  will  perhaps  be  foimd,  to  the  honour  of  Richard \nWagner's  German  nature,  that  he  has  acted  in  everything \nwith  more  strength,  daring,  severity,  and  elevation  than  a \nnineteenth-century  Frenchman  could  have  done — owing  to \n196  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nthe  circumstance  that  we  Germans  are  as  yet  nearer  to  bar-' \nbarism  than  the  French; — perhaps  even  the  most  remarkable \ncreation  of  Richard  Wagner  is  not  only  at  present,  but  for \never  inaccessible,  incomprehensible,  and  inimitable  to  the \nwhole  latter-day  Latin  race:  the  figure  of  Siegfried,  that  very \nfree  man,  who  is  probably  far  too  free,  too  hard,  to  cheer- \nful, too  healthy,  too  anti-Catholic  for  the  taste  of  old  and \nmellow  civilised  nations.  He  may  even  have  been  a  sin \n'  against  Romanticism,  this  anti-Latin  Siegfried:  well,  Wagner \natoned  amply  for  this  sin  in  his  old  sad  days,  when — antici- \npating a  taste  which  has  meanwhile  passed  into  politics — ^he \nbegan,  with  the  religious  vehemence  peculiar  to  him,  to \npreach,  at  least,  the  way  to  Rome,  if  not  to  walk  therein. — \nThat  these  last  words  may  not  be  misunderstood,  I  will  call \nto  my  aid  a  few  powerful  rhymes,  which  will  even  betray \nto  less  delicate  ears  what  I  mean — what  I  mean  counter  to \nthe  \"last  Wagner\"  and  his  Parsifal  music: — \n— Is  this  our  mode? — \nFrom  German  heart  came  this  vexed  ululating? \nFrom  German  body,  this  self-lacerating? \nIs  ours  this  priestly  hand-dilation. \nThis  incense-fuming  exaltation? \nIs  ours  this  faltering,  falling,  shambling. \nThis  quite  uncertain  ding-dong-dangling? \n\n\nThis  sly  nun-ogling,  Ave-hour-bell  ringing, \nThis  wholly  false  enraptured  heaven-o'er springing? \n— Is  this  our  mode? — \nThink  well! — ye  still  wait  for  admission — \nFor  what  ye  hear  is  Rome — Rome's  faith  by  intuitiot \nCHAPTER  IX \nWhat  Is  Noble?"

There  is  master-morality  and  slave-moral- \n\n\nity;— I  would  at  once  add,  however,  that  in  all  higher  an \nmixed  civilisations,  there  are  also  attempts  at  the  recott \nciliation  of  the  two  moralities;  but  one  finds  still  oftener \nral- \nmc^j \nonfl \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  201 \nconfusion  and  mutual  misunderstanding  of  them,  indeed^ \nsometimes  their  close  juxtaposition — even  in  the  same  man, \nwithin  one  soul.  The  distinctions  of  moral  values  have  either \noriginated  in  a  ruling  caste,  pleasantly  conscious  of  being \ndifferent  from  the  ruled — or  among  the  ruled  class,  the  slaves \nand  dependents  of  all  sorts.  In  the  first  case,  when  it  is  the \nrulers  who  determine  the  conception  \"good,\"  it  is  the  ex- \nalted, proud  disposition  which  is  regarded  as  the  distinguish- \ning feature,  and  that  which  determines  the  order  of  rank. \nThe  noble  type  of  man  separates  from  himself  the  beings  in \nwhom  the  opposite  of  this  exalted,  proud  disposition  displays \nitself:  he  despises  them.  Let  it  at  once  be  noted  that  in \nthis  first  kind  of  morality  the  antithesis  \"good\"  and  \"bad\" \nmeans  practically  the  same  as  \"noble\"  and  \"despicable\"; — \nthe  antithesis  \"good\"  and  \"evil\"  is  of  a  different  origin.  The \ncowardly,  the  timid,  the  insignificant,  and  those  thinking \nmerely  of  narrow  utility  are  despised;  moreover,  also,  the \ndistrustful,  with  their  constrained  glances,  the  self-abasing, \nthe  dog-like  kind  of  men  who  let  themselves  be  abused,  the \nmendicant  flatterers,  and  above  all  the  liars: — it  is  a  fimda- \nmental  belief  of  all  aristocrats  that  the  common  people  are \nuntruthful.  \"We  truthful  ones\" — the  nobility  in  ancient \nGreece  called  themselves.  It  is  obvious  tliat  everywhere  the \ndesignations  of  moral  value  were  at  first  applied  to  men, \nand  were  only  derivatively  and  at  a  later  period  applied  to \nactions;  it  is  a  gross  mistake,  therefore,  when  historians \nof  morals  start  with  questions  like,  \"Why  have  sympathetic \nactions  been  praised?\"  The  noble  type  of  man  regards \nhimself  as  a  determiner  of  values;  he  does  not  require  to  be \napproved  of;  he  passes  the  judgment:  \"What  is  injurious  to \nme  is  injurious  in  itself\";  he  knows  that  it  is  he  himself  only \nwho  confers  honour  on  things;  he  is  a  creator  of  values. \nHe  honours  whatever  he  recognises  in  himself:  such  morality \n202  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \n\n\nis  self-glorification.  In  the  foreground  there  is  the  feeling \nof  plenitude,  of  power,  which  seeks  to  overflow,  the  happi- \nness of  high  tension,  the  consciousness  of  a  wealth  which \nwould  fain  give  and  bestow: — the  noble  man  also  helps  the \nunfortunate,  but  not — or  scarcely — out  of  pity,  but  rather \nfrom  an  impulse  generated  by  the  super-abundance  of  power. \nThe  noble  man  honours  in  himself  the  powerful  one,  him  also \nwho  has  power  over  himself,  who  knows  how  to  speak  and \nhow  to  keep  silence,  who  takes  pleasure  in  subjecting  himself \nto  severity  and  hardness,  and  has  reverence  for  all  that  is \nsevere  and  hard.  \"Wotan  placed  a  hard  heart  in  my  breast,\" \nsays  an  old  Scandinavian  Saga:  it  is  thus  rightly  expressed \nfrom  the  soul  of  a  proud  Viking.  Such  a  type  of  man  is \neven  proud  of  not  being  made  for  sympathy;  the  hero  of \nthe  Saga  therefore  adds  warningly:  \"He  who  has  not  a \nhard  heart  when  young,  will  never  have  one.\"  The  noble  and \nbrave  who  think  thus  are  the  furthest  removed  from  the \nmorality  which  sees  precisely  in  sympathy,  or  in  acting  for \nthe  good  of  others,  or  in  disinter essement,  the  characteristic \nof  the  moral;  faith  in  oneself,  pride  in  oneself,  a  radical  en- \nmity and  irony  towards  \"selflessness,\"  belong  as  definitely  to \nnoble  morality,  as  do  a  careless  scorn  and  precaution  in \npresence  of  sympathy  and  the  \"warm  heart.\" — It  is  the  pow- \nerful who  know  how  to  honour,  it  is  their  art,  their  domain \nfor  invention.  The  profound  reverence  for  age  and  for \ntradition — all  law  rests  on  this  double  reverence, — the  belief \nand  prejudice  in  favour  of  ancestors  and  unfavourable  to \nnewcomers,  is  typical  in  the  morality  of  the  powerful ;  and  if, \nreversely,  men  of  \"modem  ideas\"  believe  almost  instinctively \nin  \"progress\"  and  the  \"future,\"  and  are  more  and  more  lack- \ning in  respect  for  old  age,  the  ignoble  origin  of  these  \"ideas\"j \nhas  complacently  betrayed  itself  thereby.  A  morality  of  thj \nruling  class,  however,  is  more  especially  foreign  and  irritating \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  203 \nto  present-day  taste  in  the  sternness  of  its  principle  that  one \nhas  duties  only  to  one's  equals;  that  one  may  act  towards \nbeings  of  a  lower  rank,  towards  all  that  is  foreign,  just  as \nseems  good  to  one,  or  \"as  the  heart  desires,\"  and  in  any  case \n\"beyond  good  and  evil\":  it  is  here  that  sympathy  and  similar \nsentiments  can  have  a  place.  The  ability  and  obligation \nto  exercise  prolonged  gratitude  and  prolonged  revenge — both \nonly  within  the  circle  of  equals, — artfulness  in  retaliation, \nraffinement  of  the  idea  in  friendship,  a  certain  necessity  to \nhave  enemies  (as  outlets  for  the  emotions  of  envy,  quarrel- \nsomeness, arrogance — in  fact,  in  order  to  be  a  good  friend) : \nall  these  are  t5rpical  characteristics  of  the  noble  morality, \nwhich,  as  has  been  pointed  out,  is  not  the  morality  of  \"mod- \n\n\nem ideas,\"  and  is  therefore  at  present  difficult  to  realise, \nand  also  to  unearth  and  disclose. — It  is  otherwise  with  the \nsecond  type  of  morality,  slave-morality.  Supposing  that  the \nabused,  the  oppressed,  the  suffering,  the  unemancipated,  the \nweary,  and  those  uncertain  of  themselves,  should  moralise, \nwhat  will  be  the  common  element  in  their  moral  estimates? \nProbably  a  pessimistic  suspicion  with  regard  to  the  entire \nsituation  of  man  will  find  expression,  perhaps  a  condemnation \nof  man,  together  with  his  situation.  The  slave  has  an  un- \nfavourable eye  for  the  virtues  of  the  powerful ;  he  has  a  scep- \nticism and  distrust,  a  refinement  of  distrust  of  everything \n\"good\"  that  is  there  honoured — he  would  fain  persuade  him- \nself that  the  very  happiness  there  is  not  genuine.  On  the \nother  hand,  those  qualities  which  serve  to  alleviate  the  ex- \nistence of  sufferers  are  brought  into  prominence  and  flooded \nwith  light;  it  is  here  that  sympathy,  the  kind,  helping  hand, \nthe  warm  heart,  patience,  diligence,  humility,  and  friendliness \nattain  to  honour;  for  here  these  are  the  most  useful  qualities, \nand  almost  the  only  means  of  supporting  the  burden  of \nexistence.    Slave-morality  is  essentially  the  morality  of  utility. \n204  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nHere  is  the  seat  of  the  origin  of  the  famous  antithesis  \"good\" \nand  \"evil\": — power  and  dangerousness  are  assumed  to  reside \nin  the  evil,  a  certain  dreadfulness,  subtlety,  and  strength, \nwhich  do  not  admit  of  being  despised.  According  to  slave- \nmorality,  therefore,  the  \"evil\"  man  arouses  fear;  according \nto  master-morality,  it  is  precisely  the  \"good\"  man  who  arouses \nfear  and  seeks  to  arouse  it,  while  the  bad  man  is  regarded \nas  the  despicable  being.  The  contrast  attains  its  maximum \nwhen,  in  accordance  with  the  logical  consequences  of  slave- \nmorality,  a  shade  of  depreciation — it  may  be  slight  and  well- \nintentioned — at  last  attaches  itself  to  the  \"good\"  man  of \nthis  morality;  because,  according  to  the  servile  mode  of \nthought,  the  good  man  must  in  any  case  be  the  safe  man:  he \nis  good-natured,  easily  deceived,  perhaps  a  little  stupid,  un \nbonkomme.  Everjrwhere  that  slave-morality  gains  the  as- \ncendency, language  shows  a  tendency  to  approximate  the \nsignifications  of  the  words  \"good\"  and  \"stupid.\" — A  last \nfundamental  difference:  the  desire  for  freedom,  the  instinct \nfor  happiness  and  the  refinements  of  the  feeling  of  liberty \nbelong  as  necessarily  to  slave-morals  and  morality,  as  artifice \nand  enthusiasm  in  reverence  and  devotion  are  the  regular \nsymptoms  of  an  aristocratic  mode  of  thinking  and  estimating. \n■ — Hence  we  can  understand  without  further  detail  why  love \nas  a  passion — it  is  our  European  specialty — must  absolutely \nbe  of  noble  origin;  as  is  well  known,  its  invention  is  due  to \nthe  Provengal  poet-cavaliers,  those  brilliant,  ingenious  men \n\n\nof  the  \"gai  saber,\"  to  whom  Europe  owes  so  much,  and \nalmost  owes  itself."

It  may  be  looked  upon \nas  the  result  of  an  extraordinary  atavism,  that  the  ordinary \nman,  even  at  present,  is  still  always  waiting  for  an  opinion \nabout  himself,  and  then  instinctively  submitting  himself  to \nit;  yet  by  no  means  only  to  a  \"good\"  opinion,  but  also  to \n2o6  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \n\n\na  bad  and  unjust  one  (think,  for  instance,  of  the  greater \npart  of  the  self-appreciations  and  self-depreciations  which \nbelieving  women  learn  from  their  confessors,  and  which  in \ngeneral  the  believing  Christian  learns  from  his  Church). \nIn  fact,  conformably  to  the  slow  rise  of  the  democratic  social \norder  (and  its  cause,  the  blending  of  the  blood  of  masters \nand  slaves),  the  originally  noble  and  rare  impulse  of  the \nmasters  to  assign  a  value  to  themselves  and  to  \"think  well\" \nof  themselves,  will  now  be  more  and  more  encouraged  and \nextended;  but  it  has  at  all  times  an  older,  ampler,  and  more \nradically  ingrained  propensity  opposed  to  it — and  in  the \nphenomenon  of  \"vanity\"  this  older  propensity  overmasters \nthe  younger.  The  vain  person  rejoices  over  every  good  opin- \nion which  he  hears  about  himself  (quite  apart  from  the  point \nof  view  of  its  usefulness,  and  equally  regardless  of  its  truth \nor  falsehood),  just  as  he  suffers  from  every  bad  opinion:  for \nhe  subjects  himself  to  both,  he  ]eeh  himself  subjected  to \nboth,  by  that  oldest  instinct  of  subjection  which  breaks \nforth  in  him. — It  is  \"the  slave\"  in  the  vain  man's  blood,  the \nremains  of  the  slave's  craftiness — and  how  much  of  the \n\"slave\"  is  still  left  in  woman,  for  instance! — which  seeks  to \nseduce  to  good  opinions  of  itself;  it  is  the  slave,  too,  who \nimmediately  afterwards  falls  prostrate  himself  before  these \nopinions,  as  though  he  had  not  called  them  forth. — And  to \nrepeat  it  agziin:  vanity  is  an  atavism."

On  the  other  hand,  it  is  known  by  the  expe- \nrience of  breeders  that  species  which  receive  superabundant \nnourishment,  and  in  general  a  surplus  of  protection  and  care. \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  207 \nimmediately  tend  in  the  most  marked  way  to  develop  varia- \ntions, and  are  fertile  in  prodigies  and  monstrosities  (also  in \nmonstrous  vices).  Now  look  at  an  aristocratic  common- \nwealth, say  an  ancient  Greek  polls,  or  Venice,  as  a  voluntary \nor  involuntary  contrivance  for  the  purpose  of  rearing  human \nbeings ;  there  are  there  men  beside  one  another,  thrown  upon \ntheir  own  resources,  who  want  to  make  their  species  prevail, \nchiefly  because  they  must  prevail,  or  else  run  the  terrible \ndanger  of  being  exterminated.  The  favour,  the  superabund- \nance, the  protection  are  there  lacking  under  which  variations \nare  fostered;  the  species  needs  itself  as  species,  as  something \n\n\nwhich,  precisely  by  virtue  of  its  hardness,  its  uniformity, \nand  simplicity  of  structure,  can  in  general  prevail  and  make \nitself  permanent  in  constant  struggle  with  its  neighbours, \nor  with  rebellious  or  rebellion-threatening  vassals.  The  most \n\\'aried  experience  teaches  it  what  are  the  qualities  to  which \nit  principally  owes  the  fact  that  it  still  exists,  in  spite  of \nall  Gods  and  men,  and  has  hitherto  been  victorious:  these \nqualities  it  calls  virtues,  and  these  virtues  alone  it  develops \nto  maturity.  It  does  so  with  severity,  indeed  it  desires  se- \nverity; every  aristocratic  morality  is  intolerant  in  the \neducation  of  youth,  in  the  control  of  women,  in  the  mar- \nriage customs,  in  the  relations  of  old  and  young,  in  the \npenal  laws  (which  have  an  eye  only  for  the  degenerating) : \nit  counts  intolerance  itself  among  the  virtues,  under  the \nname  of  \"justice.\"  A  type  with  few,  but  very  marked \nfeatures,  a  species  of  severe,  warlike,  wisely  silent,  reserved \nand  reticent  men  (and  as  such,  with  the  most  delicate  sensi- \nbility for  the  charm  and  nuances  of  society)  is  thus  estab- \nlished, unaffected  by  the  vicissitudes  of  generations;  the \nconstant  struggle  with  imiform  unfavourable  conditions  is, \nas  already  remarked,  the  cause  of  a  type  becoming  stable \nand  hard.    Finally,  however,  a  happy  state  of  things  results. \n2o8  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nthe  enormous  tension  is  relaxed;  there  are  perhaps  no  mere \nenemies  among  the  neighbouring  peoples,  and  the  means  of \nlife,  even  of  the  enjoyment  of  life,  are  present  in  super- \nabundance. With  one  stroke  the  bond  and  constraint  of  the \nold  discipline  severs:  it  is  no  longer  regarded  as  necessary, \nUs  a  condition  of  existence — if  it  would  continue,  it  can  only \ndo  so  as  a  form  of  luxury,  as  an  archaising  taste.  Varia- \ntions, whether  they  be  deviations  (into  the  higher,  finer,  and \nrarer),  or  deteriorations  and  monstrosities,  appear  suddenly \non  the  scene  in  the  greatest  exuberance  and  splendour;  the \nindividual  dares  to  be  individual  and  detach  himself.  At \nthis  turning-point  of  history  there  manifest  themselves,  side \nby  side,  and  often  mixed  and  entangled  together,  a  magnifi- \ncent, manifold,  virgin-forest-like  up-growth  and  up-striving, \na  kind  of  tropical  tempo  in  the  rivalry  of  growth,  and  an \nextraordinary  decay  and  self-destruction,  owing  to  the  sav- \nagely opposing  and  seemingly  exploding  egoisms,  which \nstrive  with  one  another  \"for  sun  and  light,\"  and  can  no \nlonger  assign  any  limit,  restraint,  or  forbearance  for  them- \nselves by  means  of  the  hitherto  existing  morality.  It  was \nthis  morality  itself  which  piled  up  the  strength  so  enor- \nmously, which  bent  the  bow  in  so  threatening  a  manner: — \nit  is  now  \"out  of  date,\"  it  is  getting  \"out  of  date.\"  The \ndangerous  and  disquieting  point  has  been  reached  when  the \n\n\ngreater,  more  manifold,  more  comprehensive  life  is  lived \nbeyond  the  old  morality;  the  \"individual\"  stands  out,  and  is \nobliged  to  have  recourse  to  his  own  law-giving,  his  owti  arts \nand  artifices  for  self-preservation,  self-elevation,  and  self- \ndeliverance.  Nothing  but  new  \"Whys,\"  nothing  but  new \n\"Hows,\"  no  common  formulas  any  longer,  misunderstanding \nand  disregard  in  league  with  each  other,  decay,  deterioration, \nand  the  loftiest  desires  frightfully  entangled,  the  genius  of  the \nrace  overflowing  from  all  the  cornucopias  of  good  and  bad, \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  20^ \na  portentous  simultaneousness  of  Spring  and  Autumn,  full \nof  new  charms  and  mysteries  peculiar  to  the  fresh,  still  in- \nexhausted,  still  unwearied  corruption.  Danger  is  again \npresent,  the  mother  of  morality,  great  danger;  this  time \nshifted  into  the  individual,  into  the  neighbour  and  friend, \ninto  the  street,  into  their  own  child,  into  their  own  heart, \ninto  all  the  most  personal  and  secret  recesses  of  their  desires \nand  volitions.  What  will  the  moral  philosophers  who  appear \nat  this  time  have  to  preach?  They  discover,  these  sharp \nonlookers  and  loafers,  that  the  end  is  quickly  approaching,, \nthat  everything  around  them  decays  and  produces  decay^ \nthat  nothing  will  endure  until  the  day  after  to-morrow,  except \none  species  of  man,  the  incurably  mediocre.  The  mediocre \nalone  have  a  prospect  of  continuing  and  propagating  them- \nselves— they  will  be  the  men  of  the  future,  the  sole  survivors; \n\"be  like  them!  become  mediocre!\"  is  now  the  only  morality \nwhich  has  still  a  significance,  which  still  obtains  a  hearing.— \nBut  it  is  difficult  to  preach  this  morality  of  mediocrity!  it \ncan  never  avow  what  it  is  and  what  it  desires!  it  has  to  talk \nof  moderation  and  dignity  and  duty  and  brotherly  love — ^it: \nwill  have  difficulty  in  concealing  its  irony!"

An \neducator  who  nowadays  preached  truthfulness  above  every- \nthing else,  and  called  out  constantly  to  his  pupils:  \"Be  true! \nBe  natural!

It  is  an  additional  instance  of  his  egoism,  this  artful- \nness and  self-limitation  in  intercourse  with  his  equals — every \nstar  is  a  similar  egoist;  he  honours  himself  in  them,  and  in \n\n\nthe  rights  which  he  concedes  to  them,  he  has  no  doubt  that \nthe  exchange  of  honours  and  rights,  as  the  essence  of  all \nintercourse,  belongs  also  to  the  natural  condition  of  things. \nThe  noble  soul  gives  as  he  takes,  prompted  by  the  passionate \nand  sensitive  instinct  of  requital,  which  is  at  the  root  of  his \nnature.

One  may  perceive  in \nalmost  every  psychologist  a  tell-tale  inclination  for  delight- \nful intercourse  with  commonplace  and  well-ordered  men: \n2i6  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nthe  fact  is  thereby  disclosed  that  he  always  requires  healing, \nthat  hft  needs  a  sort  of  flight  and  forgetfulness,  away  from \nwhat  his  insight  and  incisiveness — from  what  his  \"business\" \n— has  laid  upon  his  conscience.  The  fear  of  his  memory \nis  peculiar  to  him.  He  is  easily  silenced  by  the  judgment \nof  others;  he  hears  with  unmoved  countenance  how  people \nhonour,  admire,  love,  and  glorify,  where  he  has  perceived — \nor  he  even  conceals  his  silence  by  expressly  assenting  to \nsome  plausible  opinion.  Perhaps  the  paradox  of  his  situa- \ntion becomes  so  dreadful  that,  precisely  where  he  has  learnt \ngreat  sympathy,  together  with  great  contempt,  the  multitude, \nthe  educated,  and  the  visionaries,  have  on  their  part  learnt \ngreat  reverence — reverence  for  \"great  men\"  and  marvellous \nanimals,  for  the  sake  of  whom  one  blesses  and  honours  the \nfatherland,  the  earth,  the  dignity  of  mankind,  and  one's \nown  self,  to  whom  one  points  the  young,  and  in  view  of \nwhom  one  educates  them.  And  who  knows  but  in  all  great \ninstances  hitherto  just  the  same  happened:  that  the  multi- \ntude worshipped  a  God,  and  that  the  \"God\"  was  only  a \npoor  sacrificial  animal!  Success  has  always  been  the  great- \nest liar — and  the  \"work\"  itself  is  a  success;  the  great  states- \nman, the  conqueror,  the  discoverer,  are  disguised  in  their \n\n\ncreations  until  they  are  unrecognisable;  the  \"work\"  of  the \nartist,  of  the  philosopher,  only  invents  him  who  has  created \nit,  is  reputed  to  have  created  it;  the  \"great  men,\"  as  they \nare  reverenced,  are  poor  little  fictions  composed  afterwards; \nin  the  world  of  historical  values  spurious  coinage  prevails. \nThose  great  poets,  for  example,  such  as  Byron,  Musset,  Poe, \nLeopardi,  Kleist,  Gogol  (I  do  not  venture  to  mention  much \ngreater  names,  but  I  have  them  in  my  mind),  as  they  now \nappear,  and  were  perhaps  obliged  to  be:  m.en  of  the  moment, \nenthusiastic,  sensuous,  and  childish,  light-minded  and  im- \npulsive in  their  trust  and  distrust;  with  souls  in  which  usually \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  217 \nsome  flaw  has  to  be  concealed;  often  taking  revenge  with \ntheir  works  for  an  internal  defilement,  often  seeking  for- \ngetfulness  in  their  soaring  from  a  too  true  memory,  often \nlost  in  the  mud  and  almost  in  love  with  it,  until  they \nbecome  like  the  Will-o '-the- Wisps  around  the  swamps,  and \npretend  to  be  stars — the  people  then  call  them  idealists, — \noften  struggling  with  protracted  disgust,  with  an  ever-re- \nappearing phantom  of  disbelief,  which  makes  them  cold, \nand  obliges  them  to  languish  for  gloria  and  devour  \"faith \nas  it  is\"  out  of  the  hands  of  intoxicated  adulators: — what \na  torment  these  great  artists  are  and  the  so-called  higher \nmen  in  general,  to  him  who  has  once  found  them  out!  It  is \nthus  conceivable  that  it  is  just  from  woman — who  is  clair- \nvoyant in  the  world  of  suffering,  and  also  unfortunately \neager  to  help  and  save  to  an  extent  far  beyond  her  powers — \nthat  they  have  learnt  so  readily  those  outbreaks  of  boundless \ndevoted  sympathy,  which  the  multitude,  above  all  the  rev- \nerent multitude,  do  not  understand,  and  overwhelm  with \nprying  and  self-gratifying  interpretations.  This  sjmipathis- \ning  invariably  deceives  itself  as  to  its  power;  woman  would \nlike  to  believe  that  love  can  do  everything — it  is  the  super- \nctition  peculiar  to  her.  Alas,  he  who  knows  the  heart  finds \nout  how  poor,  helpless,  pretentious,  and  blundering  even \nthe  best  and  deepest  love  is — he  finds  that  it  rather  destroys \nthan  saves! — It  is  possible  that  under  the  holy  fable  and \ntravesty  of  the  life  of  Jesus  there  is  hidden  one  of  the \nmost  painful  cases  of  the  martyrdom  of  knowledge  about \nlove:  the  mart5n-dom  of  the  most  innocent  and  most  craving \nheart,  that  never  had  enough  of  any  human  love,  that  de- \nmanded love,  that  demanded  inexorably  and  frantically  to \nbe  loved  and  nothing  else,  with  terrible  outbursts  against \nthose  who  refused  him  their  love;  the  story  of  a  poor  soul \ninsatiated  and  insatiable  in  love,  that  had  to  invent  hell  to \n\n\n2i8  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nsend  thither  those  who  would  not  love  him — ^and  that  at \nlast,  enlightened  about  human  love,  had  to  invent  a  God \nwho  is  entire  love,  entire  capacity  for  love — who  takes  pity \non  human  love,  because  it  is  so  paltry,  so  ignorant !  He \nwho  has  such  sentiments,  he  who  has  such  knowledge \nabout  love — seeks  for  death! — But  why  should  one  deal \nwith  such  painful  matters  ?

He  who  has  sat  day  and \n\n\nnight,  from  year's  end  to  year's  end,  alone  with  his  soul  in \nfamiliar  discord  and  discourse,  he  who  has  become  a  cave- \nbear,  or  a  treasure-seeker,  or  a  treasure-guardian  and  dragon \nin  his  cave — it  may  be  a  labyrinth,  but  can  also  be  a  gold- \nmine— his  ideas  themselves  eventually  acquire  a  twilight- \ncolour  of  their  own,  and  an  odour,  as  much  of  the  depth  as \nof  the  mould,  something  uncommunicative  and  repulsive, \nwhich  blows  chilly  upon  every  passerby.  The  recluse  does \nnot  believe  that  a  philosopher — supposing  that  a  philosopher \nhas  always  in  the  first  place  been  a  recluse — ever  expressed \nhis  actual  and  ultimate  opinions  in  books:  are  not  books \nwritten  precisely  to  hide  what  is  in  us? — indeed,  he  will \ndoubt  whether  a  philosopher  can  have  \"ultimate  and  actual\" \nopinions  at  all;  whether  behind  every  cave  in  him  there  is \nnot,  and  must  necessarily  be,  a  still  deeper  cave:  an  ampler, \nstranger,  richer  world  beyond  the  surface,  an  abyss  behind \nevery  bottom,  beneath  every  \"foundation.\"  Every  philos- \nophy is  a  foreground  philosophy — this  is  a  recluse's  verdict: \n\"There  is  something  arbitrary  in  the  fact  that  the  philosopher \ncame  to  a  stand  here,  took  a  retrospect  and  looked  around; \nthat  he  here  laid  his  spade  aside  and  did  not  dig  any  deeper \n— there  is  also  something  suspicious  in  it.\"  Every  philoso- \nphy also  conceals  a  philosophy;  every  opinion  is  also  a \nlurking-place,  every  word  is  also  a  mask."

Of  whom \nam  I  talking  to  you?    Have  I  for|rotten  myself  so  far  that \nBEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL  231 \nI  have  not  even  told  you  his  name?  Unless  it  be  that  you \nhave  already  divined  of  your  own  accord  who  this  question- \nable God  and  spirit  is,  that  wishes  to  be  praised  in  such  a \n\n\nmanner?  For,  as  it  happens  to  every  one  who  from  child- \nhood onward  has  always  been  on  his  legs,  and  in  foreign \nlands,  I  have  also  encountered  on  my  path  many  strange \nand  dangerous  spirits;  above  all,  however,  and  again  and \nagain,  the  one  of  whom  I  have  just  spoken:  in  fact,  no \nless  a  personage  than  the  God  Dionysus,  the  great  equivo- \ncator  and  tempter,  to  whom,  as  you  know,  I  once  offered  in \nall  secrecy  and  reverence  my  first-fruits — the  last,  as  it \nseems  to  me,  who  has  offered  a  sacrifice  to  him,  for  I  have \nfound  no  one  who  could  understand  what  I  was  then  doing. \nIn  the  meantime,  however,  I  have  learned  much,  far  too \nmuch,  about  the  philosophy  of  this  God,  and,  as  I  said,  from \nmouth  to  mouth — I,  the  last  disciple  and  initiate  of  the \nGod  Dionysus:  and  perhaps  I  might  at  last  begin  to  give \nyou,  my  friends,  as  far  as  I  am  allowed,  a  little  taste  of \nthis  philosophy?  In  a  hushed  voice,  as  is  but  seemly:  for  it \nhas  to  do  with  much  that  is  secret,  new,  strange,  wonderful, \nand  imcanny.  The  very  fact  that  Dionysus  is  a  philosopher, \nand  that  therefore  Gods  also  philosophise,  seems  to  me  a \nnovelty  which  is  not  unensnaring,  and  might  perhaps  arouse \nsuspicion  precisely  amongst  philosophers; — amongst  you, \nmy  friends,  there  is  less  to  be  said  against  it,  except  that  it \ncomes  too  late  and  not  at  the  right  time;  for,  as  it  has  been \ndisclosed  to  me,  you  are  loth  nowadays  to  believe  in  God \nand  gods.  It  may  happen,  too,  that  in  the  frankness  of  my \nstory  I  must  go  further  than  is  agreeable  to  the  strict  usages \nof  your  ears?  Certainly  the  God  in  question  went  further, \nvery  much  further,  in  such  dialogues,  and  was  always  many \npaces  ahead  of  me.  .  .  .  Indeed,  if  it  were  allowed,  I  should \nhave  to  give  him,  according  to  human  usage,  fine  ceremoni- \n232  BEYOND  GOOD  AND  EVIL \nous  titles  of  lustre  and  merit,  I  should  have  to  extol  his \ncourage  as  investigator  and  discoverer,  his  fearless  honesty, \ntruthfulness,  and  love  of  wisdom.  But  such  a  God  does  not \nknow  what  to  do  with  all  that  respectable  trumpery  and \npomp.  \"Keep  that,\"  he  would  say,  \"for  thyself  and  those \nlike  thee,  and  whoever  else  require  it!  I — have  no  reason \ntc  cover  my  nakedness!\"  One  suspects  that  this  kind  of \ndivinity  and  philosopher  perhaps  lacks  shame? — He  once \nsaid:  \"Under  certain  circumstances  I  love  mankind\" — and \nreferred  thereby  to  Ariadne,  who  was  present;  \"in  my  opin- \nion man  is  an  agreeable,  brave,  inventive  animal,  that  has \nnot  his  equal  upon  earth,  he  makes  his  way  even  through \nall  labyrinths.  I  like  man,  and  often  think  how  I  can  still \nfurther  advance  him,  and  make  him  stronger,  more  evil,  and \nmore  profound.\" — \"Stronger,  more  evil,  and  more  pro- \nfound?\" I  asked  in  horror.  \"Yes,\"  he  said  again,  \"stronger, \n\n\nmore  evil,  and  more  profound;  also  more  beautiful\" — and \nthereby  the  tempter-god  smiled  with  his  halcyon  smile,  as \nthough  he  had  just  paid  some  charming  compliment.  One \nhere  sees  at  once  that  it  is  not  only  shame  that  this  divinity \nlacks; — and  in  general  there  are  good  grounds  for  supposing \nthat  in  some  things  the  Gods  could  all  of  them  come  to  us \nmen  for  instruction.    We  men  are — more  human. — -"
