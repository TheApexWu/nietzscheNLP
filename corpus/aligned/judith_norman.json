And we are fundamen- \ntally inclined to claim that the falsest judgments (which include synthetic \njudgments a priori) are the most indispensable to us, and that without ac- \ncepting the fictions of logic, without measuring reality against the wholly \ninvented world of the unconditioned and self-identical, without a constant \nfalsification of the world through numbers, people could not live — that a \nrenunciation of false judgments would be a renunciation of life, a negation \nof life.

From these “beliefs” they try to acquire \ntheir “knowledge,” to acquire something that will end up being solemnly \nchristened as “the truth.” The fundamental belief of metaphysicians is \nthe belief in oppositions of values. It has not occurred to even the most \ncautious of them to start doubting right here at the threshold, where it is \nactually needed the most — even though they had vowed to themselves “de \n\n\nomnibus dubitandum.”* But we can doubt, first, whether opposites even \nexist and, second, whether the popular valuations and value oppositions \nthat have earned the metaphysicians’ seal of approval might not only be \nforeground appraisals.

Imagine something like nature, profligate with- \n\n\nout measure, indifferent without measure, without purpose and regard, \nwithout mercy and justice, fertile and barren and uncertain at the same \ntime, think of indifference itself as power — how could you live according to \nthis indifference? Living — isn't that wanting specifically to be something \nother than this nature? Isn't living assessing, preferring, being unfair, \nbeing limited, wanting to be different? And assuming your imperative \nto “live according to nature\" basically amounts to “living according to \nlife” — well how could you not? Why make a principle out of what you \nyourselves are and must be? — But in fact, something quite different is \ngoing on: while pretending with delight to read the canon of your law in \nnature, you want the opposite, you strange actors and self-deceivers! Your \npride wants to dictate and annex your morals and ideals onto nature — yes, \nnature itself — you demand that it be nature “according to Stoa\" and \nyou want to make all existence exist in your own image alone — as a huge \neternal glorification and universalization of Stoicism! For all your love of \ntruth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such \nhypnotic rigidity to have a fa/se, namely Stoic, view of nature, that you \ncan no longer see it any other way, — and some abysmal piece of arro- \ngance finally gives you the madhouse hope that because you know how \nto tyrannize yourselves — Stoicism is self-tyranny —, nature lets itself be \n5 \"In came the ass / beautiful and very strong.\" According to KSA these lines could be \nG. C. Lichtenberg's Vermischte Schriften (Miscellaneous Writings) (1867), V, p. 327. \nIO \nOn the prejudices of philosophers \ntyrannized as well: because isn't the Stoic a piece of nature? ... But this \nis an old, eternal story: what happened back then with the Stoics still \nhappens today, just as soon as a philosophy begins believing in itself. It \nalways creates the world in its own image, it cannot do otherwise; philos- \nophy is this tyrannical drive itself, the most spiritual will to power, to the \n“creation of the world,” to the causa prima.^ \nIO \nAll over Europe these days, the problem “of the real and the apparent \nworld\" gets taken up so eagerly and with such acuity — I would even say: \nshrewdness — that you really start to think and listen; and anyone who \nhears only a *will to truth\" in the background here certainly does not have \nthe sharpest of ears. In rare and unusual cases, some sort of will to truth \nmight actually be at issue, some wild and adventurous streak of courage, \na metaphysician's ambition to hold on to a lost cause, that, in the end, \n\n\nwill still prefer a handful of “certainty” to an entire wagonload of pretty \npossibilities. There might even be puritanical fanatics of conscience who \nwould rather lie dying on an assured nothing than an uncertain something. \nBut this is nihilism, and symptomatic of a desperate soul in a state of \ndeadly exhaustion, however brave such virtuous posturing may appear. \nWith stronger, livelier thinkers, however, thinkers who still have a thirst for \nlife, things look different. By taking sides against appearance and speaking \nabout “perspective” in a newly arrogant tone, by granting their own bodies \nabout as little credibility as they grant the visual evidence that says “the \nearth stands still,” and so, with seemingly good spirits, relinquishing their \nmost secure possession (since what do people believe in more securely \nthese days than their bodies?), who knows whether they are not basically \ntrying to re-appropriate something that was once possessed even more \nsecurely, something from the old estate of a bygone faith, perhaps “the \nimmortal soul\" or perhaps *the old God,\" in short, ideas that helped \nmake life a bit better, which is to say stronger and more cheerful than \n“modern ideas\" can do? There is a mistrust of these modern ideas here, \nthere 1s a disbelief in everything built yesterday and today; perhaps it is \nmixed with a bit of antipathy and contempt that can no longer stand the \nbric-a-brac of concepts from the most heterogeneous sources, which is \n6 First cause. \nII \nBeyond Good and Evil \nhow so-called positivism puts itself on the market these days, a disgust felt \nby the more discriminating taste at the fun-fair colors and flimsy scraps of \nall these reality-philosophasters who have nothing new and genuine about \nthem except these colors. Here, I think, we should give these skeptical \nanti-realists and epistemo-microscopists their just due: the instinct that \ndrives them away from modern reality is unassailable, — what do we care \nfor their retrograde shortcut! The essential thing about them is not that \nthey want to go “back”: but rather, that they want to get — away. A bit \nmore strength, flight, courage, artistry: and they would want to get up and \nout, — and not go back! — \nII \nIt seems to me that people everywhere these days are at pains to divert \nattention away from the real influence Kant exerted over German phi- \nlosophy, and, in particular, wisely to overlook the value he attributed to \nhimself. First and foremost, Kant was proud of his table of categories,’ \n\n\nand he said with this table in his hands: “This is the hardest thing that \never could have been undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.\" — But let us \nbe clear about this “could have been”! He was proud of having discovered \na new faculty in humans, the faculty of synthetic judgments a priori. Of \ncourse he was deceiving himself here, but the development and rapid \nblossoming of German philosophy depended on this pride, and on the \ncompetitive zeal of the younger generation who wanted, if possible, to dis- \ncover something even prouder — and in any event “new faculties”! — But \nthe time has come for us to think this over. How are synthetic judgments \na priori possible? Kant asked himself, — and what really was his answer? By \nvirtue of a faculty, which is to say: enabled by an ability? unfortunately, \nthough, not in these few words, but rather so laboriously, reverentially, \nand with such an extravagance of German frills and profundity that peo- \nple failed to hear the comical niaiserie allemande? in such an answer. In \nfact, people were beside themselves with joy over this new faculty, and \nthe jubilation reached its peak when Kant discovered yet another faculty, \na moral faculty: — because the Germans were still moral back then, and \n7 The reference in this section is to Kant's Kritik der reinen Vernunft (Critique of Pu\n1787). \n8 Tn German: Vermóge eines Vermögens. \n9 German silliness. \nI2 \nOn the prejudices of philosophers \nvery remote from Realpolitik. — The honeymoon of German philosophy \nhad arrived; all the young theologians of the Tübingen seminary”? ran off \ninto the bushes — they were all looking for “faculties.” And what didn't \nthey find — in that innocent, abundant, still youthful age of the German \nspirit, when Romanticism, that malicious fairy, whispered, whistled, and \nsang, when people did not know how to tell the difference between “dis- \ncovering\" and “inventing”!\"’ Above all, a faculty of the “supersensible”: \nSchelling christened it intellectual intuition, and thus gratified the heart's \ndesire of his basically piety-craving Germans. We can do no greater in- \njustice to this whole high-spirited and enthusiastic movement (which was \njust youthfulness, however boldly it might have clothed itself in gray and \nhoary concepts) than to take it seriously or especially to treat it with moral \nindignation. Enough, we grew up, — the dream faded away. There came \na time when people scratched their heads: some still scratch them to- \nday. There had been dreamers: first and foremost — the old Kant. “By \nvirtue of a faculty\" — he had said, or at least meant. But 1s that really — an \nanswer? An explanation? Or instead just a repetition of the question? So \n\n\nhow does opium cause sleep? “By virtue of a faculty,” namely the virtus \ndormitiva — replies the doctor in Molière, \nquia est in eo virtus dormitiva, \ncujus est natura sensus assoupire.? \nBut answers like this belong in comedy, and the time has finally come \nto replace the Kantian question “How are synthetic judgments a priori \npossible?” with another question, “Why is the belief in such judgments \nnecessary?\" — to realize, in other words, that such judgments must be \nbelieved true for the purpose of preserving beings of our type; which \nis why these judgments could of course still be false! Or, to be blunt, \nbasic and clearer still: synthetic judgments a priori do not have “to be \npossible\" at all: we have no right to them, and in our mouths they are \nnothing but false judgments. It is only the belief in their truth that 1s \nnecessary as a foreground belief and piece of visual evidence, belonging \nto the perspectival optics of life. — And, finally, to recall the enormous \neffect that “the German philosophy” — its right to these quotation marks \n1° A reference to Hegel, Hölderlin, and Schelling. \n™ In German: “‘finden’ und ‘erfinden.’ ”? \n12 “Because there is a dormative virtue in it / whose nature is to put the senses to sl\nMoliére's Le Malade imaginaire (The Hypochondriac) (1673)."

And the higher man needs to open his ears to all cynicism, crude \nor refined, and congratulate himself every time the buffoon speaks up \nwithout shame, or the scientific satyr is heard right in front of him. There \nare even cases where enchantment mixes with disgust: namely, where \ngenius, by a whim of nature, is tied to some indiscreet billy-goat and \nape, like the Abbé Galiani, the most profound, discerning, and perhaps \nalso the filthiest man of his century.

But, as I have already suggested, \nwhat happens more often is that the scientific head is placed on an ape's \nbody, a more subtle and exceptional understanding is put in a base soul. \nThis is not a rare phenomenon, particularly among physicians and phys- \niologists of morals. And wherever even one person is speaking about man \nwithout any bitterness but instead quite innocuously, describing him as a \nstomach with dual needs and a head with one; wherever someone sees and \nseeks and wants to see only hunger, sex-drive and vanity, as if these were \nthesole and genuine motivating forces of human action; in short, wherever \nsomebody is speaking “badly” of people — and not even mickedly — this is \nwhere the lover of knowledge should listen with subtle and studious atten- \ntion. He should keep his ears open wherever people are speaking without \nanger. Because the angry man, and anyone who is constantly tearing and \nshredding himself with his own teeth (or, in place of himself, the world, or \nGod, or society), may very well stand higher than the laughing and self- \nsatisfied satyr, considered morally.

Asa sort of epistemological skepticism, modern \n\n\nphilosophy is, covertly or overtly, anti-Christian (although, to state the \npoint for more subtle ears, by no means anti-religious). People used to \nbelieve in “the soul” as they believed in grammar and the grammatical \nsubject: people said that “I” was a condition and “think” was a predicate \nand conditioned — thinking is an activity, and a subject must be thought \nof as its cause. Now, with admirable tenacity and cunning, people are \nwondering whether they can get out of this net — wondering whether the \nreverse might be true: that “think” is the condition and “I” is conditioned, \nin which case “I” would be a synthesis that only gets produced through \nthought itself. Kant essentially wanted to prove that the subject cannot \nbe proven on the basis of the subject — and neither can the object. The \npossibility that the subject (and therefore “the soul\") has a merely apparent \nexistence might not always have been foreign to him, this thought that,"

They are not enemies of religious customs; if circumstance \n(or the state) requires them to take part in such customs, they do what \nis required, like people tend to do —, and they do it with a patient and \nunassuming earnestness, without much in the way of curiosity or unease: \nthey just live too far apart and outside to even think they need a For or \nAgainst in such matters.

But it is the strongest of all and the most amazing in that \nvast intermediary zone where Europe, as it were, flows back into Asia: in \nRussia. There, the strength to will has been laid aside and stored up over \na long time; there, the will is waiting threateningly (uncertain whether as \na will of negation or of affirmation), to be discharged (to borrow a favorite \nterm from today’s physicists).

So, considering the fact that humanity has been \nthe best and most long-standing breeding ground for the cultivation \nof obedience so far, it is reasonable to suppose that the average per- \nson has an innate need to obey as a type of formal conscience that com- \nmands: “Thou shalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally not \ndo something,” in short: “Thou shalt.” This need tries to satisfy itself \nand give its form a content, so, like a crude appetite, it indiscriminately \ngrabs hold and accepts whatever gets screamed into its ear by some com- \nmander or another — a parent, teacher, the law, class prejudice, public \nopinion — according to its strength, impatience, and tension. The oddly \nlimited character of human development — its hesitancy and lengthi- \nness, its frequent regressions and reversals — is due to the fact that the \nherd instinct of obedience is inherited the best and at the cost of the \nart of commanding.

The fact then \nemerges that the overwhelming majority of things that interest and ap- \npeal to the more refined and discriminating tastes, to every higher nature, \nwill strike the average person as utterly *uninteresting.\" If he notices a \ndevotion to it anyway, then he calls it “désintéressé” and wonders how it is \npossible to act in a “disinterested” fashion. There have been philosophers \nwho have even known how to express this popular perplexity in a seductive \nand mystico-otherworldly way (— perhaps because they did not have first- \nhand knowledge of higher natures?) — instead of laying down the naked \nand fully proper truth that a “disinterested” action is a very interesting \n\n\nand interested action, provided . . . “And love?” — What? Even an action \ndone out of love is supposed to be “unegoistic”? But you fools — ! “And \npraise for the self-sacrificing?\" But anyone who has really made sacrifices \nknows that he wanted and got something in return, — perhaps something \nof himself in return for something of himself — that he gave up here in \norder to have more there, perhaps in order to be more in general, or just \nto feel like “more.” But this is a realm of questions and answers in which \na more discriminating spirit will not want to stay for very long: the truth \nis already desperate to keep herself from yawning when she is required to \nrespond.

An example of this is the \nmistaken ideas about tragedy that have been nurtured by both ancient \nand modern philosophers. This is my claim: almost everything we call \n“higher culture” is based on the spiritualization and deepening of cruelty. \nThe “wild animal” has not been killed off at all; it is alive and well, it \nhas just — become divine. Cruelty is what constitutes the painful sensu- \nality of tragedy. And what pleases us in so-called tragic pity as well as in \neverything sublime, up to the highest and most delicate of metaphysical \ntremblings, derives its sweetness exclusively from the intervening com- \nponent of cruelty. Consider the Roman in the arena, Christ in the rapture \nof the cross, the Spaniard at the sight of the stake or the bullfight, the \npresent-day Japanese flocking to tragedies, the Parisian suburban laborer \nwho is homesick for bloody revolutions, the Wagnerienne who unfastens \n12 “Without genius and without spirit.” \nOur virtues \nher will and lets Tristan und Isolde “wash over her” — what they all enjoy \nand crave with a mysterious thirst to pour down their throats is “cruelty,” \nthe spiced drink of the great Circe. We clearly need to drive out the silly \npsychology of the past; the only thing this psychology was able to teach \nabout cruelty was that it originated from the sight of another’s suffering. \nBut there is abundant, overabundant pleasure in your own suffering too, \nin making yourself suffer, — and wherever anyone lets himself be talked \ninto self-denial in the religious sense, or self-mutilation (as the Phoenicians \nor ascetics did), or into desensitization, disembowelment or remorse in \ngeneral, or into puritanical penitential spasms, vivisections of conscience \nor a Pascalian sacrifizio dell'intelletto'? — wherever this is the case, he is \nsecretly being tempted and urged on by his cruelty, by that dangerous \nthrill of self-directed cruelty. Finally, people should bear in mind that \neven the knower, by forcing his spirit to know against its own inclina- \ntion and, often enough, against the wishes of his heart (in other words, \nto say “no” when he would like to affirm, love, worship), this knower \nwill prevail as an artist of cruelty and the agent of its transfiguration. \nEven treating something in a profound or thorough manner is a violation, \na wanting-to-hurt the fundamental will of the spirit, which constantly \ntends towards semblances and surfaces, — there is a drop of cruelty even \nin every wanting-to-know."

Its needs and abilities are the same ones that physi- \nologists have established for everything that lives, grows, and propagates. \nThe power of spirit to appropriate foreign elements manifests itself in a \nstrong tendency to assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold, \nto disregard or push aside utter inconsistencies: just as it will arbitrarily \nselect certain aspects or outlines ofthe foreign, of any piece ofthe “external \nworld,” for stronger emphasis, stress, or falsification in its own interest. Its \n13 Sacrifice of the intellect. \nI2I \nBeyond Good and Evil \nintention here is to incorporate new “experiences,” to classify new things \ninto old classes, — which is to say: it aims at growth, or, more particularly, \nthe feeling of growth, the feeling of increasing strength. This same will \nis served by an apparently opposite drive of spirit, a suddenly emerging \nresolution in favor of ignorance and arbitrary termination, a closing of its \nwindows, an inner nay-saying to something or other, a come-no-closer, a \ntype of defensive state against many knowable things, a contentment with \ndarkness, with closing horizons, a yea-saying and approval of ignorance: \nall of which are necessary in proportion to the degree of its appropriating \nforce, its “digestive force,” to speak metaphorically — and really, “spirit” \nresembles a stomach more than anything. The spirit's occasional will to be \ndeceived belongs here too, perhaps with a playful hunch that things are not \none way or the other, that people just accept things as one way or the other, \nasense of pleasure in every uncertainty and ambiguity, a joyful self-delight \nat the arbitrary narrowness and secrecy of a corner, at the all-too-close, \nthe foreground, at things made bigger, smaller, later, better, a self-delight \nat the sheer caprice in all these expressions of power. Finally, the spirit's \nnot quite harmless willingness to deceive other spirits and to act a part in \nfront of them belongs here too, that constant stress and strain of a creative, \nproductive, mutable force. What the spirit enjoys here is its multiplicity \nof masks and its artfulness, and it also enjoys the feeling of security these \nprovide, — after all, its Protean arts are the very things that protect and \nconceal it the best! — This will to appearances, to simplification, to masks, \nto cloaks, in short, to surfaces — since every surface is a cloak — meets \n\n\nresistance from that sublime tendency of the knower, who treats and wants \nto treat things in a profound, multiple, thorough manner. This is a type of \ncruelty on the part of the intellectual conscience and taste, and one that \nany brave thinker will acknowledge in himself, assuming that he has spent \nas long as he should in hardening and sharpening his eye for himself, and \nthat he is used to strict discipline as wellas strict words. He will say *There \nis something cruel in the tendency of my spirit”: — just let kind and vir- \ntuous people try to talk him out of it! In fact, it would sound more polite \nif, instead of cruelty, people were to accuse, mutter about and praise us as \nhaving a sort of *wild honesty\" — free, very free spirits that we are: — and \nperhaps this is what our reputation will really be — posthumously?

In almost ev- \nery psychologist, you find a telling inclination and preference for dealing \nwith normal, well-ordered people.

Only ever \nbirds that have flown and flown astray until they are tired and can be \ncaught by hand, — by our hand! We only immortalize things that cannot \nlive and fly for much longer, only tired and worn-out things! And I only \nhave colors for your afiernoon, my written and painted thoughts, perhaps \nmany colors, many colorful affections and fifty yellows and browns and \ngreens and reds: — but nobody will guess from this how you looked in \nyour morning, you sudden sparks and wonders of my solitude, you, my \nold, beloved — — wicked thoughts! \n?!
